1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
so before we get into some of the
material today on loss function

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,429
optimization I wanted to go over some
administrative things first

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:12,859
just as a reminder of the person Simon
is due on next Wednesday so you have

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:18,100
roughly nine days left and just as a
warning Monday is holidays so there will

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,050
be no class in office hours so plan out
your time accordingly to make sure that

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,920
you can complete the assignment in time
of course he also have some late two

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,960
days that you can use and allocate among
your silence as you see fit

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,149
ok so I diving into the material first
i'd like to remind you where we are

9
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:39,100
currently last time we looked at this
problem visual recognition as

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,950
specifically at image classification and
we're talking about the fact that this

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,780
is actually a very difficult problem
right so he just consider the cross

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,829
product called the possible variations
that we have to be robust to when we

13
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,198
recognize any of these categories such
as cat just seems like such an

14
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,049
intractable and possible problem and not
only do we know how to solve these

15
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,108
problems now but we can solve this
problem for thousands of categories and

16
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,859
the state of the art methods work almost
at human accuracy or even slightly

17
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:11,829
surpassing it and some of those classes
and it's also runs nearly in real kind

18
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:16,539
of your phone and so basically and all
of this also happened in the last three

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,790
years and also you'll be experts by the
end of the class on all of this

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,609
technology so it's really cool and
exciting oK so that's the problem of

21
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:27,140
classification of a commission we talked
specifically about the data German

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,450
approaching the fact that we can't just
explicitly hardcode these classifiers so

23
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,100
we have to actually trained them from
Dana and so we looked at the idea of

24
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,188
having different the training data
having the validation splits where we

25
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:41,408
just had our hyper parameters and a test
that that you don't touch too much we

26
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:44,810
look specifically at the example of the
nearest neighbor classifier and someone

27
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,618
and the canyons neighbor classifier and
I talked about the secret India said

28
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:52,938
which is our Toyota said that we play
with during this class then I introduced

29
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:58,438
the idea of this approach that I termed
paratroop approach which is really that

30
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,639
we're writing a function from image
directly to the tennis courts that have

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,618
10 closest and the spermatic formerly
seem to be a long year for us so we just

32
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,520
have equal WX and we talked about the
interpretations of this linear

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,850
classifier the fact that you can

34
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,039
interpreted as matching templates or
that you can interpret it as these

35
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,449
images being in the very
high-dimensional space and arlen your

36
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,560
class partner kind of going in and
coloring this space my class course so

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,740
to speak and so by the end of the class
we got to this picture where we suppose

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,240
we have a training example training
dataset them just three images here

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,530
along the columns and we have some
classes say 10 classes and support n and

40
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,740
basically this function assigning scores
for every single one of these images

41
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,510
with some particular setting off weights
which have chosen randomly here we got

42
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:47,939
some scores out and so some of these
results are good and some of them are

43
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,419
bad so if you inspect this course for
example in the first image you can see

44
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,509
that the correct class or just cat got a
score of 2.9 and that's kind of in the

45
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:00,060
middle so some some classes he received
a higher score which is not very good

46
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,289
some classes received a much lower score
which is good for that particular image

47
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:09,019
the car was very well classified because
the car was much higher than all of the

48
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,980
other ones and the Frog was enough
durable classified all right so we have

49
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:18,199
this notion that four different weights
these different weights work better or

50
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,389
worse on different images and of course
we're trying to find a way it's that

51
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:26,209
give us course that are consistent with
all the ground truth labels labels and

52
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,490
the data and so what we're going to do
now is so far with only I believe what I

53
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,590
just described like this is good and
that's not so good and so on but we have

54
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,900
to actually give it a shot

55
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,710
actually quantify this notion we have to
say that this particular set of weights

56
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,189
WSA like 12 bad or 1.5 bad or whatever
and then once we have this loss function

57
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:47,710
we're going to minimize it so we're
going to find W that gets us the lowest

58
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,830
loss and we're going to look into that
today we're going to look specifically

59
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,830
into how we can define a loss function
that measures this unhappiness and then

60
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,030
we're actually going to look at two
different cases a boston soft max costs

61
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,840
costs and then we're going to look into
the process optimization which is how do

62
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,000
you start off with these random audits
and how do you actually find very very

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,110
good sighting of weight sufficiently so
I'm going to downsize this example that

64
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,620
we have a nice working example to work
with suppose we only had three classes

65
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,030
and stuff you know

66
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:22,009
tens of thousands and we have these
three images and these are our scores

67
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:23,360
for some setup W

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,949
we're going to now try to write down
exactly our unhappiness with this result

69
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,680
of the first loss we're going to look
into it is termed a multi-class SVM loss

70
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,629
this is a generalization of a minority
support vector machine that you may have

71
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:42,379
seen over the closest I think between 9
covers as well and so the setup here is

72
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:47,710
that we miss core function right so as a
vector of Lacoste course these are our

73
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,948
inspectors and there's a specific term
here

74
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,348
loss equal stew stuff and I'm going to
interpret this loss now for Easter that

75
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:59,978
and we're going to see through a
specific example of why this expression

76
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:06,158
excess effectively what the SVM losses
same is that it's something across all

77
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:11,399
the incorrect examples so all the all
the same across all the incorrect course

78
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:17,209
classes so for every single example we
have that loss and it's coming across

79
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:20,769
all the incorrect classes and it's
comparing the score at the core class

80
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:25,209
received in this court that the
incorrect class receipt Jane minus s why

81
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:31,269
I why I being the correct label plus one
and then that smacks of zero so what's

82
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:35,838
going on here as we're comparing the
difference in this course and this

83
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:40,338
particular lost the same that not only
do I want the correct score to be higher

84
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:43,918
than the incorrect score but there's
actually a safety margin that we putting

85
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,079
on will put were using a safety margin

86
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:53,198
exactly one and we're going to go into
why one makes sense to use as opposed to

87
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,900
some other hyper primary that we have to
choose their and intuitively you can

88
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:00,508
look into notes for a much more rigorous
derivation of exactly why that one

89
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,278
doesn't matter but then too early to
think about this underscores our kind of

90
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:08,500
scale-free because I can skim I W I can
make it larger or smaller and you're

91
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,490
going to get larger or smaller course so
really there's this pre-primary off

92
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,550
discourse and how large or small they
can be that is tied to how large or

93
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,930
weights are in magnitude and so these
whores are kind of arbitrary so using

94
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:25,269
one is just an arbitrary choice to some
extent ok so let's see specifically how

95
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:29,128
this expression works with a concrete
example so here I am going to evaluate

96
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,899
that loss for the first example so here
we're competing for plugging in this

97
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,949
course so we see that we're comparing

98
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:40,829
the score we got your car from 1-3 point
to which is the correct class car and

99
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:45,219
then adding our safety margin of one and
the maximum 0 and that is really what

100
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,770
it's doing is it's going to be clamping
values 80 right so if we get a negative

101
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:53,759
result we're going to exclude VAT 0 so
if you see the second class for the

102
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,089
incorrect Plaza frog

103
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:59,699
1.7 subtracted from 3.2 at a safety
margin and we gonna get to a point nine

104
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,629
and then when you work this through you
get a loss of 2.9

105
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,209
intuitively what you can see here the
way this worked out is intuitively the

106
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:12,930
cat score is 3.2 so according to ESPN
Los we would we would like ideally is

107
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,100
that the scores for all the classes are
up to it most

108
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,370
2.2 but the car class actually had much
higher much higher score than one and

109
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,620
this difference in what we would have
liked which is 2.2 and what actually

110
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,939
happened just like 11 is exactly this
difference of 2.9 which is how bad of a

111
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:36,129
score outcome this was and in the other
case in fraud case you can see the proc

112
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,139
score was quite a bit lower than low 2.2
and so the way that works out then the

113
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,289
math is that you end up getting a
negative number when you compare this

114
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,110
course and then the max 2000 lost
contribution for that particular part

115
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:54,439
and you end up with a loss of 2.9 oK so
that's the loss for this first major for

116
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,050
the second image we're going to again do
the same thing

117
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,689
plug in the numbers were comparing the
cats got the car score so we get my

118
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:07,329
point three months from 19 at a safety
margin and the same for the other class

119
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,659
so when you plug in your actually end up
with a lot of zero and loss of 0

120
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,280
intuitively is because the car score
here is it is true that the car score is

121
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,479
higher than all the others course for
that image by at least one right that's

122
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,490
why we got zero score 0 lost that is so
the constraint was satisfied and some of

123
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,310
their loss and in this case we end up
with a very bad loss because of course

124
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,470
the frog class received a very low score
but the other classes received quite

125
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,349
high school so this adds up to an
unhappiness of 10.9 and now if we

126
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,520
actually want to combine all of this
into a single loss function we're going

127
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,929
to do the relatively intuitive
transformation here we just take the

128
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,049
average across all the losses we obtain

129
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:51,458
empower training set and so it would say
that the loss at the end when you

130
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:56,369
average these numbers is 4.6 so this
particular setting up w on this training

131
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,320
data gives us some course which we plug
into the loss function and we've given

132
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,170
and unhappiness a four-point sex with
this result ok so not going to ask you a

133
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,939
series of questions to kind of test your
understanding a bit about how this works

134
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,390
I'll get into questions in a bit let me
just pose my friend Michael questions

135
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:20,230
first of all what if that's over there
which is some overall the incorrect

136
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,560
colossus of Jane whatever that means
that some overall the closest not just

137
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,799
the incorrect ones so what if we allowed
J to equal to why I why am I actually

138
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:39,149
adding that small constraint in the
summer there yes so in fact what would

139
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,139
have happened is the reason the better
gnite equal to I as if we allowed to I

140
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,539
then score of why I cancel reply

141
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:49,828
you end up with a zero and really what
you're doing is you're adding a constant

142
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:53,549
of London so if that someone's overall
this course then really maybe just

143
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:59,250
completing the loss by constant of 10
that's why that's their second what if

144
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,940
we used a mean instead of a sudden right
so I'm summing up over all these

145
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,500
constraints what if I used to mean just
like I'm using mean to actually averaged

146
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,389
over all the losses for all the examples
what if I use the mean over this course

147
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:28,000
the score concerns there were too many
classes so you're right in that the

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,870
absolute value of the loss will be lower

149
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,879
a constant factor why

150
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:52,689
did actually do an average here would be
averaging over the number of classes

151
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,220
here but there's a constant number of
classes say three in the specific

152
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,889
example

153
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,000
amounts to putting constant of one-third
in front of the loss and since we're

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,450
always in the end so that would make the
Los lower just like you pointed out but

155
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,820
in the end what we're always interested
in as we're going to minimize aw over

156
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,470
that loss so if you're shifting your
lost by one or if you're scaling it with

157
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,350
a constant is actually doesn't change
our solutions but you're still going to

158
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,420
end up at the same optimal W so these
choices are kind of basically free

159
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:23,169
parameters doesn't matter so for
convenience I'm adding do not equal to Y

160
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:26,299
and I'm not actually taken to mean
although it's the same thing and the

161
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:33,329
same goes for us for whether or not we
average for some across the examples ok

162
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,410
next question what if we instead used
not to the formulation of there but a

163
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:42,669
very similar looking for inflation but
there's an additional squared at the end

164
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:47,809
so we're taking the difference between
course plus one this morning and then

165
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:54,509
were squaring that do we obtain the same
or different lost when you think we

166
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,710
obtain the same or different loss in a
sense that if you were to optimize and

167
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:05,759
find the best W do we get the same
result or not

168
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:20,340
yes in fact get a different loss it's
not as obvious to see but what one way

169
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:26,639
to see it as that we're not just clearly
scaling not just clearly scaling the Los

170
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,710
up or down by constant or shifting it by
constant we're actually changing the

171
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,580
differences we are changing the
tradeoffs nonlinearly in terms of how

172
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,920
the SVM support vector machines going to
go there and trade all the different

173
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:43,519
score margins in different examples but
it's not obvious to see but basically

174
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,829
it's not very clear but I want to to
illustrate that all changes to this loss

175
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:53,320
are completely and the second permission
here is in fact something we call a

176
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,530
squared hinge loss instead of the one on
top which recall hinge loss and you can

177
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:01,480
use two different kind of hyper
primarily 20 use most often you see the

178
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,750
first formulation that's what we use
most of the time but sometimes you can

179
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,950
see these assets with the square inch
loss and better so that's something you

180
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,550
play with that's really hyper primer but
its most often used for the first one

181
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:18,919
let's also think about the scale of this
loss was the min and max possible loss

182
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:23,149
that you can achieved with the
multi-class SVM on your entire dataset

183
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:26,759
what is the smallest Mali

184
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:35,029
0 good what is the highest value so
basically scores could be arbitrarily

185
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:39,870
terrible so if you're signed score to
the correct example is very very small

186
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:45,230
then you're going to get your loss going
to infinity and one more question which

187
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,480
becomes kind of important when we start
doing optimization usually when we

188
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,200
actually optimize these loss functions
we start up with the initialization aw

189
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,430
that are very small weights so what ends
up happening is that the scores at the

190
00:13:56,429 --> 00:14:00,819
very beginning of optimization are
roughly near zero all of these are black

191
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,650
small numbers near zero so what are the
loss when all these are new era in this

192
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:12,329
particular case that's right number of
classes minus 10 if all this course are

193
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,639
zero then he would this particular loss
I put down here and by doing an average

194
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,269
across this way we would have achieved a
loss of two ok so this is not very

195
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,429
important what's important is for safety
checks when you're actually starting

196
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:28,399
optimization and you're starting with
very small numbers W and you print out

197
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,389
your first loss as you're talking about
migration and you want to make sure that

198
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:34,279
you kind of understand the functional
forms and that they can think through

199
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,929
whether or not the number you get to
make sense so I'm seeing to in this case

200
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:42,799
then I'm happy that the further losses
may be implemented correctly percent

201
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,990
sure but shortly certainly there's
nothing wrong with it right away so it's

202
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,730
interesting to think about these I'm
going to go more into this loss of tiny

203
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,950
bit but as a question in terms of the
slide right now

204
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:10,870
question I was asked questions

205
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,029
efficient to actually not have this
constraint joy is not why I because it

206
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:19,049
makes it more difficult to actually do
these easy better eyes implementations

207
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:23,799
of this loss implementation so that
actually predict my next slide to some

208
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,459
degree so let me just going to say here
sometime by code for Hollywood right out

209
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,290
to this loss function in the same here
we're evaluating a lie in bed right now

210
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:37,759
we're getting a single example here so
acts as a single column vector light is

211
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,279
an integer specifying the label and W is
our weight matrix so what we do is we

212
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,799
validate this course which is just a
couple times X then we compute these

213
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,179
margins which is the difference between
the course we obtained and the correct

214
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:55,569
score + 10 these are numbers between 0
and whatever and then see this dish

215
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:03,360
online margins that y equals 0 YZ them
there

216
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,320
yeah exactly so basically I'm doing this
efficient backgrounds importation which

217
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,209
goes to your point and then I want to
embrace that margin there because I'm

218
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,569
certain that margin said why currently
has one and I don't want to inflate my

219
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,360
score and so I'll set at 20

220
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:27,269
yes I suppose you could subtract one of
the end as well so we can optimize if we

221
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:31,200
want but we're not going to think about
this too much if you do if you do in

222
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,050
your assignment that's very welcome for
extreme punishments and there were some

223
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:40,859
of those markets and so we got lost
going back to the site anymore questions

224
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,320
about this formulation and by the way
this formulation if you wanted to make

225
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,430
it if you actually write it down for
just two closest you'll see that it

226
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:57,229
reduces to a minor support vector
machine lost ok so we'll see a different

227
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,190
function soon and then we're going to
look at the comparisons of them as well

228
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,400
but for now actually so at this point
what we have is we have this

229
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,699
wrapping up its course and then we have
this loss function which have not

230
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,870
written out and its full form where we
have these differences between this

231
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:18,178
course +1 some of her closest and the
Sun and the average across hold examples

232
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,309
right so that's the loss function right
now I'd like to convince you that

233
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:25,149
there's actually a bug with this loss
function in other words if I'd like to

234
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:31,798
use this loss on Sunday as in practice I
might get some not very nice properties

235
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,589
ok if this if this was the only thing I
was using my phone and it's not

236
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,709
completely obvious to see exactly what
the issue is so I'll give you guys a

237
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,620
hint in particular suppose that we found
the W

238
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:55,058
getting zero loss ok on something and
now the question is is this w unique or

239
00:17:55,058 --> 00:18:00,329
face another way can you give me aww
that would be different but also

240
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,210
definitely achieve zero loss in the back

241
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:12,410
that's right and so you're saying we can
scale it by some constant and in

242
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:20,009
particular all formats are based on
constraint you probably want to meet

243
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:24,259
young greater than one right so
basically what I can do as I can change

244
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:28,119
my weight and make them larger and
larger all I would be doing is I'm just

245
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:31,639
create making the score differences
larger and larger as I came up w right

246
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,890
because of the liquor law sport here so
basically it's not a very desirable

247
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,370
property because we have the entire
subspace of W that is optimal and all of

248
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,319
them are according to this loss function
completely the same but intuitively

249
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,019
that's not what I can burn as property
to pass and so just to see this in

250
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:51,920
america to convince yourself that this
is the case I taking this example of

251
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,480
what we achieved previously 0 loss there
before and I suppose I W I twice I mean

252
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,360
this is a very simple math going on here
but basically I would be conflicting or

253
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:07,000
my scores by two times and so their
difference would also becomes larger so

254
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,019
if all your score differences inside the
max 50 well already negative then

255
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:14,389
there's going to become more and more
negative and so you end up with larger

256
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,040
and larger negative values inside them
access and just become zero all the time

257
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:32,159
but the scale factor would have to be
larger than 1 because

258
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:56,940
another question for simplicity but yeah
basically scores are WX + be so so

259
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,309
you're just yet

260
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:06,589
forget to buy some just chillin W myself
ok so the way to fix this is intuitively

261
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:10,250
we have this entire subway some W's and
it all works the same according to this

262
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,269
loss function and what we'd like to do
as we'd like to have a preference over

263
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:17,170
some W's over others just based on
intrinsic you know what what do we

264
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,430
desire of W to look like forget the data
is just what what are nice things to

265
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,110
happen and so this introduces the notion
of regularization which we're going to

266
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:29,319
be attending to our loss function so we
have an additional term there which is

267
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:33,309
land up times a regularization function
of W and the regularization function

268
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:37,500
measures the niceness of your W ok and
so we don't only want to fit the data

269
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,279
but we also won W to be nice and we're
going to see some ways of framing that

270
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,549
exactly why they make sense and into
going on as regularization has a way of

271
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:52,509
trading off your training act your
training loss and your generalization

272
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:56,589
lost on a test set so intuitively
regularization a set of techniques where

273
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,899
we're adding objectives to the loss
which will be fighting with this guy so

274
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,560
this guy just wants to fit your training
data and that guy once W to look some

275
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,879
particular way and so they're fighting
each other sometimes in your objective

276
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,730
because we want to simultaneously
achieve both of them but it turns out

277
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,470
that adding these regularization
techniques even if it makes your

278
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,319
training error worse so we're not
correctly classifying examples which he

279
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,599
noticed is that the test set performance
and something better and we'll see an

280
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,089
example of why that might be actually
what the next for now I just want to

281
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:29,109
point out the next light but for now I
just want to point out that the most

282
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:33,019
common form of realization is the what
we call to regularization or weight

283
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:37,539
decay and really what we're doing is
suppose W in this case is a 2d matrix so

284
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:42,230
I had to some Sauveur que el the rows
and columns that really is just

285
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,230
element wise W squared

286
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,019
and we're just putting them all into the
Los ok so this this particular

287
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:55,069
regulation it likes w's to be 0 right so
when WS all 09 realization is happy but

288
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:58,649
of course you can't people there because
then you can classify so these guys will

289
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,140
fight each other there are different
forms of regularization with different

290
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,570
approaching Kong's will go into some of
them much later in the class and I just

291
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:12,548
like the 2nd Lt regularization is the
most common form and that's what you'll

292
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:17,569
use quite often in this class as well
it's not like to convince you I'd like

293
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,529
to convince you that this is a
reasonable thing to want out of it w

294
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:25,779
that its weights are small so consider
this very simple cooked up example to

295
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,149
get the intuition suppose we have an
example where we are in four-dimensional

296
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,370
space where we're doing this
classification and we have an even

297
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:36,139
better off just all once X and now
suppose we have these two candidates

298
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,880
weight matrices or wait

299
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,780
single voice I suppose to right now so
one of them is 100 and the other is 25

300
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:49,200
everywhere since we have in your loss
functions you'll see that their effects

301
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,080
are the same so basically have a leading
scorer is by WX so the doc product with

302
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,109
ex is identical for both of these
discourse with both of these but

303
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:03,469
regularization with strictly favor one
of these over the other which one with

304
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,720
the regularization cost favor even
though their effects are the same which

305
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,548
one is better in terms of realization
the second one right and so the

306
00:23:13,548 --> 00:23:15,740
regularization would tell you that even
though they're achieving the same

307
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,109
effects in terms of the data loss
classification down the road we actually

308
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:22,629
significantly preferred the second one
what's better about the second one is

309
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,340
that a good idea to have

310
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:38,230
that's correct so well that's one
interpretation I like the most is well

311
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,549
it takes into account the most number of
things in your X Factor right so what

312
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:47,859
this Delta realization wants to do is to
spread out your WSUS as much as possible

313
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,169
so that you're taking into account all
the input features are only empathic

314
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,900
sauce and wants to use as much as many
other dimensions as it likes its a

315
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,600
cheating the same effect

316
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,439
intuitively speaking and so that's
better than just focusing on just one

317
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,990
dimension is just nice it's something
that often works in practice basically

318
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,880
just the way things are and biggest
arranged and the property that they

319
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,230
usually have to tackle any questions
about the regularization good idea

320
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,130
everyone has sold some basically our
losses will always have this forum where

321
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,350
we we have a dinner loss and they will
also have a regularization it's a very

322
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:29,529
common thing to have in practice ok I'm
not going to go into the second

323
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:34,629
classifier pacifier and we'll see some
differences between the US and support

324
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,070
vector machine and this soft mask
classifier in practice these are kind of

325
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:41,369
like these two choices that you can have
either a spam or something like the most

326
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:47,629
commonly used linear classifiers often
you'll see that so far as preferred and

327
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,480
I'm not exactly sure why because usually
the end up working about the same and I

328
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,420
just like to mention that this is also
sometimes called multnomah was just

329
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,019
aggression so if you're familiar with
logistic regression this is just the

330
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:00,190
generalization of it into multiple
dimensions or in this case multiple

331
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:12,009
clouds of smoke just as they're
questioned over there

332
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:32,150
why do we want to use if we'd like to
pick between them in some way and I

333
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,820
think we are going for is that one thing
low W us is a reasonable way to pick

334
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:42,700
among men and the ultra-right favor
diffuse w's like in this case here and

335
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,900
one of the intuitive ways in which I can
try to pitch why this is a good idea is

336
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:54,290
that diffuse weights basically see this
w one is completely ignoring your inputs

337
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:58,220
to three and four but W two is using all
of the inputs right because of the way

338
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,480
to defuse and so intuitively this just
end up usually working better at a test

339
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,150
I'm because more evidence is being
accumulated and your decisions instead

340
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:21,470
of just one single evidence one single
feature that's right

341
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:28,140
that's right that's right so the idea
here is that these two W 110 w to

342
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,630
achieving the same effect so this data
loss suppose that that's basically it

343
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,650
doesn't care between the two but the
regularization expressed a preference

344
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,169
for them and since we had any objective
and we're going to end up optimizing

345
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:42,240
over this loss functions are going to
find the W that simultaneously

346
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,659
accomplishes both of those and so we end
up aw that not only classified correctly

347
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:50,360
but we also have the added preference
that actually wanted to be and we wanted

348
00:26:50,359 --> 00:27:05,668
to be diffuse as much as possible could
also be indifferent L one has some nice

349
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:09,240
properties which I don't want to go into
right now we might cover it later fell

350
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:16,579
one has some properties like a sparsity
inducing properties what if you end up

351
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:20,240
having lunch in your objectives you'll
find that lots of W's will end up being

352
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,329
exactly zero for reasons that we might
go into labor and that sometimes is like

353
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:30,629
a feature selection almost and so I'll
one is another alternative that we might

354
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:45,760
go into a bit more later

355
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:54,220
that isn't it may be a good thing that
were ignoring features and just using

356
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:02,960
one of them yeah there's many technical
reasons why realization is a good idea I

357
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,090
went to give you just basic intuition so
maybe maybe tell them that but I think

358
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:59,740
that's a fair point if I have a good
return I would have to be ignoring some

359
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:25,980
and looking at times and learning theory
and you saw some of that in 229 and

360
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,710
there are some results on white
regularization is a good case in in

361
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,650
those areas and I don't think I'm gonna
go into that and salt also beyond the

362
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,610
scope of this class so far this class
just altering our nation will make your

363
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:44,139
test error better someone to go to
satisfy to find out which is just

364
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,309
generalization of logistic regression to
the way the way this will work as this

365
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:53,049
is just a different functional form for
how loss is specified on top of these

366
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:58,539
course some particular there's this
interpretation that classifier puts on

367
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:02,170
top of this course these are not just
some arbitrary scores and we want to

368
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,769
margins to be met but we have specific
interpretation that is maybe more

369
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:10,549
principled kind of from a problem that
point of view where we actually

370
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,490
interpret these course not just as these
things that mean margins but these are

371
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,880
actually the normalized lock
probabilities that are assigned to

372
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,140
different classes ok so we're going to
go into exactly what this means in a bit

373
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,880
these are normalized lock probabilities
of all the twice given the image in

374
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,490
other words we are assuming that the
scores are unlike problem peace than the

375
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:38,799
way to get probabilities of the closest
like Sasuke is that we take these the

376
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,690
score

377
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:45,029
exponential all of them to get the
anomalous probabilities and we normalize

378
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:48,849
them to get them to normalize
probabilities so we divided by the sum

379
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:54,209
over all the exponential its course and
that's how we actually get this

380
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,240
expression for a probability of a class
given the image and so this function

381
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,880
here is called a soft max function if
you see if someone has to eat to them

382
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,840
the elements are currently interested in
divided by the sum overall expense sheet

383
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,918
its course that's the way this will work
basically is if we're in this problem

384
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,040
premark we're really lucky

385
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,869
that we're deciding that this is the
probability of different classes that

386
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:19,619
makes sense in terms of what you what
you really want to do in this setting

387
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:23,809
will probably over different classes one
of these is correct so we wanted to

388
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:25,429
maximize the log-likelihood

389
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:32,900
for the loss function and so we want to
maximize the log likelihood of the true

390
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,140
class and since we're running a loss
function we want to minimize the

391
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,980
negative log-likelihood of the true
class ok so you end up with a series of

392
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,599
expressions here really are lost
function as you want the log-likelihood

393
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:51,169
the correct class to be high so negative
of it want to be low and the

394
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,820
log-likelihood is some expansion of
course let's look at a specific example

395
00:31:54,819 --> 00:32:00,599
to make this more later here I actually
like something that expression so that

396
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,839
this is the Los negative log that
expression let's look at how this

397
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,859
expression works and I think it'll give
you a better intuition know exactly what

398
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,009
this is doing lights what's computing so
suppose here we haven't these scores

399
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:16,379
that came out from our neural network or
from our earlier pacifier and these are

400
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,780
the unlock problem peace so as I
mentioned we want to exponentially them

401
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:22,879
first because under this interpretation
that gives us the normalized

402
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,150
probabilities and now he's always some
21 so we have two divided by the sum of

403
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:33,310
all of these so we add up these guys and
we divide to actually get probably out

404
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:37,609
under this interpretation we've carried
out the set of transformations and what

405
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:41,219
this is saying is that this
interpretation the probability assigned

406
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:47,029
to this image of being a cat is 13% car
is 87% and progress very unlikely 0%

407
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:51,399
these are the probabilities and not
normally in the setting you want to

408
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,960
maximize the lock probability because it
turns out that maximizing just a rock

409
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,049
probability is not as nice
mathematically so lonely you see

410
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:03,460
maximizing luck probabilities and then
so you want to minimize the probability

411
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,850
so the correct class here is cat which
is only having 13 percent chance

412
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:14,679
Anderson misinterpretation so negative
log of points 13 gets us 89 and so

413
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:21,180
that's the final to find a loss that we
would achieve for this class here under

414
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,529
this interpretation of a classifier so
29

415
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:32,869
let's go over some examples were some
questions now related to this to try to

416
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:34,219
interpret exactly how this works

417
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,519
first I was the min and max possible
lost with this loss function so that the

418
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,460
loss function what is the smallest Mali
and the highest body has to think about

419
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,809
this what is the smallest value that we
can cheap zero and how would that happen

420
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:57,220
I can get so if you're correct class is
getting probably have one where we have

421
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,890
a one was replying to the law and we're
getting negative log of 110 and the

422
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:09,030
highest possible loss so just as well as
we were getting the same 0 is minimum

423
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:14,250
and infinite is maximum so infant loss
would be achieved if you end up giving

424
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,769
your cat score very tiny probability and
then log of 0 gives you negative

425
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:24,679
infinity so negative that is just the
infinite so yeah so the same balance as

426
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,159
p.m. and also this question

427
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,440
normally when we initialize W with
roughly small small weights wind up with

428
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,550
all these cars are nearly zero what ends
up being the loss in this case

429
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,419
checks at the beginning of your
optimization what do you expect to see

430
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:47,000
as your first loss

431
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:59,449
one over a number of classes so you may
be getting older is here you get to all

432
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:04,139
of one's here and so here is one over a
number of classes and then they get a

433
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:07,599
blog about and something your final
awesome so actually for myself whenever

434
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,569
I run up my station I sometimes take
note of my number of classes and I

435
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,970
evaluate negative log one of a number of
classes and I'm trying to see what is

436
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:18,429
the my first beginning lost expect and
so when I start up my decision I make

437
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:21,159
sure that I'm getting roughly that
otherwise I know some things may be

438
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,399
slightly off expect to get something on
that order

439
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,630
moreover as an optimizing expect that I
go from thats 20 and if I'm seeing

440
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,039
negative numbers then I know from the
functional form that something very

441
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,590
strange is going on right

442
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:37,070
never actually expected gonna give
numbers out of this assault max loss

443
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,630
I'll show you one more slide nothing
some questions just to reiterate the

444
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,599
difference between them and really what
they look like as we have the score

445
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,909
function which gives aw we get our
scores of actor and now the difference

446
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:54,420
is just how they interpret what these
course coming out from this function is

447
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,500
so I just ran its course no
interpretation whatsoever we just want

448
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,710
that a lot of a larger score the correct
score to be some margin above the

449
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,240
incorrect course or interpreted to be
these unless lott probabilities and then

450
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,569
in this framework we first went to get
the probabilities and then we want to

451
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:14,450
maximize the public in the crack losses
or the log of them and so that ends up

452
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:19,250
giving us the loss function or something
so they start off at the same way but

453
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,780
they just happened to get to the
difference less results we're going to

454
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:31,150
exactly what the differences are in a
bit there are questions

455
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:41,579
they take your classified as near
instantaneous to evaluate most of the

456
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,949
work is done in the convolutions and so
will see that the classifier and

457
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:51,629
especially the losses roughly the same
of course South max involve some XP and

458
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,200
so on so these operations are slightly
more expensive perhaps but usually it

459
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,439
completely washes away

460
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,320
compared to everything else you're
worried about which is all the

461
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:15,260
competitions over the image of God

462
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:32,600
probably

463
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:42,210
exact same problem and so maximizing the
property and maximizing the locality

464
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,119
give you the identical result but in
terms of the match everything comes out

465
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:49,279
too much nicer looking when you actually
put a lot of there but it's the exact

466
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,310
same optimization problem

467
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:56,539
ok let's get some interpretations of
these two and exactly how they differ

468
00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:01,230
max vs SEM and trying to give you an
idea about one property that actually

469
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,559
quite different between the two

470
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,059
these two different functional analysis
team that we have these three examples

471
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:12,710
all three examples and suppose there are
three closest three different examples

472
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,980
and these are discourse of these
examples for every one of these examples

473
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,659
the first class here is the correct
class so 10 is the correct class score

474
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:24,509
and the other scores are these guys
either the first one second or third one

475
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:30,970
and now just think about how would these
losses tell you about how desirable

476
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:36,480
outcomes are in terms of that w in
particular one way to think about it for

477
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,530
example is suppose I think this data
point the third one tenth of a hundred

478
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:44,700
and eight hundred and suppose I jiggle
it move it around a bit and my input

479
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:58,159
space what is happening to the losses as
I do that

480
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:03,339
I do so they increase and decrease as I
would go around do they both increase or

481
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:10,050
decrease for the third appointment for
example as me and remains the same

482
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,740
correct and why is that it's because the
margin was met by a huge amount so

483
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:17,659
there's just added robustness when I
take the day off on a sheet around the

484
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:22,379
SVM is already very happy because the
margins were met by you know we desire

485
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:27,809
margin of one and here we have a margin
of two hundred and there's a huge margin

486
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:32,299
ESPN doesn't express a preference over
these examples where this course come

487
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:37,010
out very negative ads no additional
preference over do I want to be negative

488
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:43,890
2009 200,000 PSP and wound care but the
s but the South max could always see you

489
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:46,659
will always get an improvement for
something that's right so soft max

490
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:49,480
function express a preference for
everyone's needs to be negative about

491
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,590
two hundred or five hundred or thousand
of them will give you better loss right

492
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,530
but the SVM at this point doesn't care
if the other examples I don't know if

493
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:03,320
it's as clear distinction rights of the
FBI has decided robustness to it once

494
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,120
this margin to be met but beyond that it
doesn't micromanage your course where

495
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,400
soft max will always want peace course
to be you know everything here nothing

496
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,300
there and so that's one kind of very
clear difference between the two

497
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:20,548
it was a question

498
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:28,568
yes the margin of one I mentioned very
briefly that that's not a hyper primary

499
00:40:28,568 --> 00:40:34,528
you can fix it to be one reason for that
is that lease course they're the kind of

500
00:40:34,528 --> 00:40:40,048
the absolute values of those course are
kind of don't really mattered because my

501
00:40:40,048 --> 00:40:45,088
W I can make it a larger or smaller and
I can achieve different sizes course and

502
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:49,759
so one turns out to work better and in
the notes I have a longer duration go

503
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:54,699
into details exactly why one is safe to
choose so refer to that but i dont wanna

504
00:40:54,699 --> 00:41:03,239
spend time on it in like 20 would be if
you wanna 20 there would be trouble you

505
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:07,358
can use any positive number and that
would give you a nice p.m. if he was 0

506
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:14,328
that would look different

507
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:18,259
for example this added constant there
one property gives you when you actually

508
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:21,920
go through the mathematical analysis
likes in the ass p.m. in CST 29 as

509
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,269
you'll see that the chief suspects
margin property where the Eskimo playing

510
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:29,698
that the best margin when you actually
have a plus

511
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:33,539
constant their combined with the altar
regularization on the way it's very

512
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:38,499
small weights that meet specific margin
and as well give you this very nice mix

513
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:42,259
margin property that I didn't really
going to in this in this lecture right

514
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:46,818
now but I basically do want a positive
number there otherwise things would

515
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:51,480
break

516
00:41:51,480 --> 00:42:14,780
numbers that are real numbers and we're
kind of free to get in this course out

517
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,200
and it's up to you to endow them with
interpretation right we can have

518
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:21,669
different losses in this specific case I
showed you the closest p.m. there's

519
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,180
multiple versions of a multi-class SVM
you can paddle around with exactly the

520
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:30,750
Los expression in one of the one of the
interpretations we can put on this

521
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,510
course then there'd be some normalized
block probably say they can't be

522
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,590
normalized because they just came we
have to explicitly because there's no

523
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:42,180
constraint that the output of your
function will be normalized and they

524
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:45,579
have to be the camp probably because
you're out that in just his real numbers

525
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:51,309
that can be positive or negative so we
interpret them as a problem peace and

526
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:52,699
and done

527
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:58,329
requires us to treat them some very bad
kind of explanation of it but I think

528
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:05,889
he's got

529
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:57,139
energy and losses like kind of an
equivalent of all about what you're

530
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:05,690
saying look at this one here right here
saying if I googled this around

531
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,460
nothing's changing I think the
difference is the loss would definitely

532
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,800
change for max even though it wouldn't
change a lot but I would definitely

533
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,660
change the subject to express preference
whereas p.m. guess you identically zero

534
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:27,339
wouldn't be very big blunder differently
as preference but in practice basically

535
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:32,720
this distinction the interaction of
trying to give you is that the SPM has a

536
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:38,469
very local part of the space immature
classifying that it cares about and

537
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:40,279
beyond it

538
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,700
its environment and a soft max kind of
physical action of the full data cloud

539
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:48,129
it cares about it cares about all the
points in your data cloud not just you

540
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,590
know there's like a small class here
that you're trying to separate out from

541
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,410
everything else

542
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:55,659
assault Maxwell kind of concerned the
full data closet getting your plane and

543
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:59,059
SPM just want to separate out that tiny
piece from the immediate part of the

544
00:44:59,059 --> 00:45:04,219
data cloud like that in practice when
you actually run the state can give

545
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:09,569
nearly identical results almost always
so really when trying to I'm not trying

546
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,640
to pitch one or the other I'm just
trying to give you this notion that

547
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,809
you're in charge of the loss function
you get some scores out and you can

548
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:19,199
write down nearly any mathematical
expression

549
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,279
is differentiable into what you want
your scores to be like and there are

550
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,619
different ways of actually formulating
this and actually two examples that are

551
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:30,579
coming to see practice but in practice
we can put down any losses for what you

552
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:34,619
want your scores to be and that's a very
nice picture because we can optimize

553
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:46,700
overall let me show you an interactive
web them at this point

554
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:54,289
alright see this so this is an
interactive seminar class page you can

555
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:58,409
find it at this URL I wrote it last year
and I have to show it to all of you guys

556
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:04,279
to justify spending one day on
developing ok but some that your last

557
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:12,440
year not too many people looked at this
vehicle is one day of my life so we have

558
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,000
here is a two-dimensional problem with
three classes and I'm showing here three

559
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,139
classes each has three examples over
here in two dimensions and I'm showing

560
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:24,969
the three classifiers here because the
level set aside for example the red

561
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:29,659
classifier is as scores of 0 along the
line and then I'm showing the arrows

562
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:35,509
which scores increased right here's RW
matrix so as you recall the W matrix

563
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,609
double rows of that w matrix are the
different classifiers so we have the

564
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:42,289
blue classifier red and green classifier
and Brett classifier and we have both

565
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:47,349
the weights for both the X&Y component
and also the bias and then here we have

566
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:50,609
the data said so we have the X&Y
coordinates of all the data points there

567
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:55,779
correct label and thus course as well as
the loss achieved by all those data

568
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,769
points right now with this setting up w
and so you can see that I'm taking the

569
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:04,568
mean overall the loss so right now our
data losses 2.77 regularization loss for

570
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:08,509
this w is 3.5 and talk hola 6.27

571
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:14,810
and so basically you can fiddle around
with this so so as I change my W you can

572
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:19,328
see that here I'm making my W one of the
WC bigger and you can see what that does

573
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:25,940
in in their order bias you can see the
bias basically shut these high plains

574
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:32,639
okay and then what we can do is we can
we're going to work this kind of a

575
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:35,848
preview of what's going to happen we're
getting the loss here and there were

576
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:38,829
going to do back propagation which has
given us the gradient over how we want

577
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:44,359
to adjust these W it's in order to make
the law smaller and so we're going to do

578
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:48,838
is this repeated states where we start
off with this w but now I can improve I

579
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:54,460
can improve this set of W's so when I do
a perimeter update this is actually

580
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,568
using these gradients which are shown
here in the right now and it's actually

581
00:47:57,568 --> 00:47:59,900
making a tiny changed everything

582
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,088
according to this gradient right so as I
do

583
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:07,699
primary update you can see that the loss
here is decreasing special the total

584
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:11,338
loss here so the lost just keeps getting
better and better as I do primary date

585
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:16,639
so this is the process of optimization
that we're going to go into in a bit so

586
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,989
I can also start a repeated update and
then basically we keep improving this w

587
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:24,808
over and over until our loss it started
off was roughly three or something that

588
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:29,579
you are mean loss over the data is point
one like that and we're correctly

589
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:39,068
classifying all these buttons here so I
can also randomized randomized W so just

590
00:48:39,068 --> 00:48:41,980
kind of knocks it off and then there's
always converges these acting point

591
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:47,650
through the process optimization and you
can play here with the regularization as

592
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,730
well you have different forms of loss so
the one I shown you right now is there

593
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,990
was a consensus p.m. formulation there's
a few more SPM formulations and there's

594
00:48:55,989 --> 00:49:01,098
also soft max here you'll see that when
I Swisher soft max loss our losses look

595
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:06,670
different and but the solution and are
being roughly the same so when I switch

596
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,700
back to him you know the type of players
move around the tiny bit but really it's

597
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:21,558
it's mostly the same and so this is just
a size so this is how much how big steps

598
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,650
are we making when we get the gradient
on how to improve things so much promise

599
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:29,119
we should start with the very biggest
upside the scenes are giggling trying to

600
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,309
separate out these data points and then
over time we're going to be doing in a

601
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:36,430
position as we're going to decrease our
updates eyes and this thing or just

602
00:49:36,429 --> 00:49:43,298
slowly converging on the premise that we
want in the end and so so you can play

603
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:47,170
with us and you can see how he scores to
go around and what the losses and if I

604
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:53,358
stop repeated update you can also drag
these points but I think on the Mac it

605
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:58,598
doesn't work so I tried to drag this
point it disappears so good

606
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:02,479
but it works on a desktop so I don't go
in and figure out exactly what happened

607
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:14,480
there but they can play with this

608
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:30,840
we have as mean loss over data plus
regularization this is one other diagram

609
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,240
to show you how did what this looks like
I don't think it's a very good diagram

610
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:38,858
and there's something confusing about it
that I can't remember from last year but

611
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:45,269
basically you have this data and why
your images your labels and there's W

612
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:49,719
and keeping this course and getting the
lawsuit and the regularization losses

613
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:54,939
only function of the weights not of the
data and mister what we want to do now

614
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,608
is we don't have control over the data
set right that's given to us we have

615
00:50:58,608 --> 00:51:04,130
control over that w and as we changed at
W the loss will be different so for any

616
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,340
W give me I can compute the loss and
that lost is linked to how well we're

617
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,730
classifying all of our examples so one
thing a low loss means world-class find

618
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,880
them very very well on the training data
and then we're crossing our fingers that

619
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,809
also works on some test data that we
haven't seen so here's one strategy for

620
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:26,139
optimization it's a random search so
because we can evaluate loss for any

621
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:30,500
arbitrary W when I can afford to do and
I'm not sure if i dont im go through

622
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,480
this in full detail but effectively I
randomly sampled and I can check their

623
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,460
loss and I can just keep track of the W
that works best

624
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:43,090
oK so that's an amazing process of
optimization of getting check and it

625
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:46,760
turns out if you do this I think I tried
two thousand times if you do this

626
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,970
thousand times and take the best W found
at random and you run it on your seat

627
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:56,108
bartend data just made up you end up
with about 15.5 percent accuracy and

628
00:51:56,108 --> 00:52:01,150
since they're acting classes are the
mean baseline as a 10% chance

629
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:06,559
performance so 15.5 there some signal
actually notably and so state of the art

630
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,219
is that ninety-five which is a common
that so we have some got too close over

631
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:10,980
the next

632
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:17,670
two weeks or so so this is so don't use
this just because it's on the slides one

633
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:21,659
interpretation of exactly what this
looks like this process optimization is

634
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:25,399
that we have this loss landscape right
this loss landscape is in this high

635
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:32,619
dimensional W space so here we sit here
in 3d and your losses the height then

636
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:38,369
you only have 2 W's in this case and
you're here and you're blindfolded W you

637
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:42,269
can see where the valleys are but you're
trying to find low loss as you're

638
00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:45,699
blindfolded and you have an altitude
meter and so you can tell what your

639
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:49,029
losses at any single point and you're
trying to get to the bottom of the

640
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:55,430
valley right and so that's really the
process of optimization and what we've

641
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:59,399
shown you would actually so far as this
random optimization where you teleport

642
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,309
around and you just check your altitude
right so not the best idea so we're

643
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:06,940
going to do instead is we're going to
use what I refer to as a gradient or

644
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:12,800
really we're just computing the slope
across in every single direction so I'm

645
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,990
trying to compute the slope and then I'm
going to go downhill ok so we're

646
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:21,289
following the slope I'm not going to go
into too much detail on this but

647
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:24,779
basically there's an expression for the
gradient which is defined like that

648
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:31,859
there's a derivative populist 101
definition and multiple dimensions if

649
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:35,409
you have a director of derivatives
that's referred to as the gradient right

650
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:39,589
so because we have multiple dimensions
multiple w's we have a gradient vector

651
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:45,660
ok so this is the expression and in fact
we can numerically evaluate the

652
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:48,769
expression before I go into the Analects
how to show you what that would look

653
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:54,190
like to evaluate the gradient at some W
suppose we have some current W and we're

654
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:58,500
getting some loss ok what we want to do
not want to get an idea about the slope

655
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,239
at this point so we're going to
basically look at this formula and we're

656
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:07,329
just going to evaluated so I'm going to
go in the first dimension and I'm going

657
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:11,840
and really what this is telling you to
do is evaluate explosive your altitude

658
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,590
at Xmas H subtracted from FFX and divide
by H

659
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:19,800
what that response to as me being on
this landscape taking a small step in

660
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,130
some direction and looking whether or
not my foot went up or down

661
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:27,340
right that's what the gradient is
telling me so I took a small step and

662
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:32,150
the lost there is 1.25 then I can use
that formula with a finite difference

663
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:36,230
approximation we review the small H two
actually derived that the gradient here

664
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:41,199
as negative 2.5 the slope downwards so I
took a step the loss and decreased so

665
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:45,480
the sloping downwards in terms of the
loss function so negative 2.5 in that

666
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,369
particular dimension so I can do this
for every single dimension independently

667
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:53,210
right so I go into the second dimension
I add a small amount so I step in a

668
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:56,869
different direction I look at what
happened to the loss I use that formula

669
00:54:56,869 --> 00:55:00,969
and is telling me that the gradient the
slope is 2.6 I can do that in the third

670
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:06,429
dimension and I get the grieving ok so
what I'm referring to here is basically

671
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:11,149
evaluating the numerical ingredient
which is using the spine a difference

672
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:14,539
approximation where for every single
dimension independently I can take a

673
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:18,500
small step at the loss and that tells me
the slower is it going upwards or

674
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:23,829
downwards for every single one of these
parameters and so this is America

675
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:28,500
gradient the way this would look like it
is by con funk shun here it looks ugly

676
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,630
because it turns out it's slightly
tricky to iterate over all the W's but

677
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:36,780
basically we're just looking at age
comparing two effects and dividing by

678
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:41,200
age and we're getting agreement now the
problem with this is if you want to use

679
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:44,960
the numerical gradient event of course
we have to do this for every single

680
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,949
dimension to get a sense of what the
great iam this endeavor single dimension

681
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:53,079
and right when you have a comment you
have hundreds of millions of parameters

682
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:58,139
right so we can't afford to actually
check the loss in hundreds of millions

683
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:02,920
of primaries before we do a single step
so this approach where we would try to

684
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,869
evaluate the gradient numerically is
approximate because we're using finite

685
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:11,119
difference approximation second is also
extremely slow because I need to do

686
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,460
million checks on the loss function on
the icon that before I know what the

687
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,519
gradient doesn't I can take a primary
update so very slow approximate turns

688
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:26,730
out that this is all so silly right
because the loss as a function of W as

689
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,800
we've written about it and really what
we want is we want the gradient of the

690
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,220
last 11 respectively and luckily we can
just write that down

691
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:42,598
thanks to these guys actually know who
those guys are doing that's right you

692
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:49,400
know which is which could just get a
look remarkably similar but basically

693
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,289
anything like this to inventors of
calculus there's actually controversy

694
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:59,429
over who really invented calculus and
these guys each other over it but

695
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:03,799
basically calculus is this powerful
hammer and so what we can do is instead

696
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,440
of doing the silly thing we're
evaluating numerical gradient we can

697
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,230
actually use calculus and we can break
down an expression for what the gradient

698
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:14,880
is off the loss function in the white
space so basically instead of fumbling

699
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,289
around and doing this is it going up or
is it going down by checking the loss I

700
00:57:18,289 --> 00:57:22,509
just have an expression where I take the
gradient of this and I can sync simply

701
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:26,500
evaluate what the entire matter is that
the only way that you can actually run

702
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,159
this in practice right we can just an
expression for years the gradient we can

703
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:35,149
do to stop and so on so in summary
basically numerical gradient approximate

704
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:39,800
slow but very easy to write because
you're just doing this very simple

705
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:44,190
process for any damage or loss function
I can get the gradient vector for a

706
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,659
gradient which is you actually do
calculus its exact no finite

707
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:52,210
proclamations it's very fast but it's
error-prone because you actually have to

708
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:57,300
do math right so in practice what you
see is we always use a lot of gradient

709
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,380
we do calculus we figure out what the
gradient should be but then you always

710
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,789
check your implementation using an
American gradient check as its referred

711
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:10,480
to so I will do all I care about the
loss function should be I write an

712
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,500
expression for the gradient I evaluated
in my code so I get in the holiday

713
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,769
greetings and then I also have a lead in
numerical gradient on the side and that

714
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:22,280
takes a while but you mature you have a
lead to more convenient and you make

715
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,890
sure that those two are the same and
then we say that you passed the green

716
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:29,500
truck oK so that's what you see in
practice whenever you try to develop a

717
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,519
new module for internal network you're
right I would have lost your right to

718
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:35,759
backward pass for a complete the
gradient and then you have to make sure

719
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,250
the gradient check it just to make sure
that your calculus is correct and then I

720
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,980
already referred to this process of
optimization which we saw nicely in the

721
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,838
Web Demo where we have this

722
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:49,548
loop when we optimized where we simply
Valley the gradient on your loss

723
00:58:49,548 --> 00:58:53,759
function and then knowing the gradient
we can perform a primer update when we

724
00:58:53,759 --> 00:58:58,509
change the WBI tiny amount in particular
we want to update with the negative

725
00:58:58,509 --> 00:59:04,509
step-size times the gradient the
negative is there because the gradient

726
00:59:04,509 --> 00:59:07,478
tells the direction of the greatest
increase it tells you which way the

727
00:59:07,478 --> 00:59:10,848
losses increasing and want to minimize
it which is where the negative it's

728
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:14,298
coming from where to go and negative
reading direction step size here as a

729
00:59:14,298 --> 00:59:17,818
hyper primary that will cause you a huge
amount of headaches step size are

730
00:59:17,818 --> 00:59:23,298
learning rate this is the most critical
parameter to basically worry about that

731
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:27,778
really there's two that you have to
worry about the most the step size or

732
00:59:27,778 --> 00:59:31,539
learning rate and there's the
regularization strength lame duck that

733
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:35,180
we saw already those two parameters are
really the two largest headaches and

734
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:45,219
that's usually what we cross body Dover
was a question about but it's not that

735
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:50,849
great just great and it tells you the
slope in every single direction and then

736
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:56,109
we just take a step by step it so the
process of opposition in the weight

737
00:59:56,108 --> 01:00:00,768
space is your somewhere in your W you
get your gradient any March some amount

738
01:00:00,768 --> 01:00:05,228
in the direction of the gradient but you
don't know how much so that the step

739
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:08,449
size and you saw that when I increase
the step size in the demo things were

740
01:00:08,449 --> 01:00:11,248
jubilant generating around quite a lot
right there was a lot of energy no

741
01:00:11,248 --> 01:00:15,449
system that's because I was taking huge
jumps all over this base and so here the

742
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:19,578
loss function is minimal at the blue
part there and it's high in the reports

743
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:23,920
so we want to get to them as part of the
basin this is actually with the loss

744
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,579
function looks like Princess p.m. or
discretion is our complex problems so

745
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:31,729
it's really just a bowl and we're trying
to get to the bottom of it but this bowl

746
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:35,009
is like 30,000 dimensional so that's why
takes awhile

747
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:39,640
ok so we take a step and we we evaluate
the gradient and repeat this over and

748
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:44,980
over in practice there's this additional
part I wanted to mention where we don't

749
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:49,860
actually evaluate the loss for the
entire training did in fact all we do is

750
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:53,370
we only use what's called me back
reading the st. where we have this

751
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:58,670
entire dataset but we sample batches
from it so we sample sale like say

752
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:02,300
thirty two examples out of my training
data I evaluate the loss of the gradient

753
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,940
on this batch of 32 and then I knew my
primary update and I keep doing this

754
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:09,619
over and over again and make sure what
ends up happening is if you only sample

755
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:14,699
very few data points from training data
then your estimate of the gradient of

756
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:18,109
course over the entire training set is
kind of noisy because you're only

757
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:21,970
estimating based on a small subset of
your data but it allows me to step more

758
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:25,689
so you can do more steps with
approximate gradient or you can do few

759
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:30,179
steps with exact gradient and practice
what ends up working better if used me

760
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:35,049
back and it's much more efficient of
course and it's impractical to actually

761
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:41,550
do fullback gradient descent so come in
many sizes 32 64 128 256 this is not

762
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:45,940
usually hyper primarily worry about too
much usually settled based on whatever

763
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,380
fits on your GPU we're going to be
talking about BP's in a bit but they

764
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:53,030
have finite amount of memory say about
like 6 gigabytes or talk about its good

765
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:58,030
GPU and usually choose a backside such
that a small me back to example spits in

766
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,150
your memory so that's how usually that's
the term and it's not a primary that

767
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:09,570
actually matters a lot and optimization
sense

768
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:14,789
and we're going to get the momentum in a
bit but if you want to use momentum then

769
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:18,969
this is just fine we always been about
trying to send but momentum very common

770
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:23,799
to do so just to give you an idea of
what will this look like in practice if

771
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,510
I'm running optimization overtime and
i'm looking at the Los evaluated on just

772
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:32,700
a small many batch of data and you can
see that basically my loss goes down

773
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:37,309
over time on these many batches from the
training data so as an optimizing I'm

774
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:42,119
going downhill now of course if I was
doing pullbacks gradient descent so this

775
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:44,839
was not just me back a sample from the
data you wouldn't expect as much noise

776
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,550
you just expect this to be aligned to
just goes down but because we use me

777
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,730
back if you get this noise in there
because something about you are better

778
01:02:51,730 --> 01:03:01,980
than others but over time they could all
go down there question

779
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:07,539
yes sir you're wondering about the shape
of this loss function you're used to

780
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:11,420
maybe seeing more rapid improvement
quick are these loss functions come in

781
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:17,079
different shapes sizes so it really
depends it's not necessarily the case

782
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:21,940
that loss function must look very sharp
in the beginning although sometimes they

783
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:25,929
do they have different shapes for
example it also matters on your

784
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:29,618
initialization if I'm careful with my
initialization I would expect less of a

785
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:34,990
jump but if I initialize very
incorrectly then you would expect that

786
01:03:34,989 --> 01:03:38,649
that's going to be fixed very early on
in the optimization we're going to get

787
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:43,309
to some of those parts I think much
later I also want to show you a lot of

788
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:49,710
the effects of learning rate on your
loss function and the still learning

789
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:53,820
rate is the step size basically a very
high learning rates or step sizes you

790
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:59,240
start rushing around in your W space and
so i dont converge or you explode if you

791
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:02,618
have a very low learning rate then
you're barely doing any updates and also

792
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:07,869
it takes a very long time to actually
converge and if you have a high learning

793
01:04:07,869 --> 01:04:11,150
rate sometimes you can basically get a
kind of stuck in a bad position of a

794
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:14,950
loss so these loss functions kind of you
need to get down to the minimum so if

795
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:17,929
you have too much energy in your
stocking too quickly when you don't have

796
01:04:17,929 --> 01:04:21,679
you don't allow your problem to kind of
settle in on the smaller local minima

797
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,480
your objective in general when you talk
about neural networks and optimization

798
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,320
you'll see a lot of hand waving because
that's the only way we communicate about

799
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,350
these losses and distance so just
imagine like a Big Basin of loss and

800
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:36,069
there are these like smaller pockets of
smaller loss and so if you're thrashing

801
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:39,480
around and you can settle in on a
smaller loss parts and converter for

802
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,730
their so that's why the learning rate so
good and so you need to find the correct

803
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:47,150
learning rate which will cause a lot of
headaches and what people do most of the

804
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,970
time is sometimes you start off with a
high learning rates we get some benefits

805
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:55,319
and then UDK it over time to start up
with high and then we decadence learning

806
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,780
read over time as we're settling in on
the good solution and I also want to

807
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:03,550
point out who's going to this in much
more detail but the way I'm doing the

808
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:07,890
update here which is how to use the
gradient to actually modify your W

809
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:12,789
that's called an update firmware update
there are many different forms of doing

810
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:14,869
it this is the simplest way which were

811
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:20,299
just STD simplest custom greeting cent
but there are many formulas such as

812
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,740
momentum that was already mentioned in
momentum you basically imagine as you're

813
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:27,949
doing this optimization you imagine
keeping track of this blog city so as

814
01:05:27,949 --> 01:05:31,389
I'm stepping am also keeping track of my
velocity so if I keep seeing a positive

815
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:35,519
reading some direction I will accumulate
velocity in that direction so I don't

816
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:39,550
need someone to go faster at the russian
and so there are several from Los will

817
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:46,100
look and shortly the class but Thomas
prop Adam or commonly used so just to

818
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:50,569
show you what these look like these
different choices and what they might do

819
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:56,760
in your loss function this is a figure
from Alec so here we have a loss

820
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:02,390
function and these are low-level clerks
and we start off opposition over there

821
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:06,920
and we're trying to get to the basin and
different update formulas will give you

822
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,670
better or worse convergence in different
problems so you can see for example this

823
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:15,369
momentum in green it built up momentum
as it went down and then it overshot and

824
01:06:15,369 --> 01:06:19,259
then it kind of go back go back and this
as UD takes forever to converge can read

825
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:23,370
that's what I presented you so far as
she takes forever to emerge and are

826
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:27,489
different ways of actually performing
this primary up there are more or less

827
01:06:27,489 --> 01:06:35,259
efficient in modernization will see much
more of this I also wanted to mention at

828
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:39,950
this point as likely yes I want to go
slightly into I'm to explain obviously

829
01:06:39,949 --> 01:06:43,049
like your classification we know how to
set up the problem we know that are

830
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:47,070
different loss functions me know how to
optimize them so we can kind of do at

831
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:51,050
this point across I wanted to mention
that I want to give you a sense of what

832
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:53,710
computer vision looked like before
comments came about so that you have a

833
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:57,920
bit of historical perspective because we
used a linear classifiers all the time

834
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,019
but of course you don't usually your
classic cars on the road original image

835
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:06,759
because that's all you want to believe
we solve the problems with it like you

836
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,250
have to cover all the modes and so on I
thought the police to do as they used to

837
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:14,380
compute all these different feature
types of images and then you can view

838
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:17,160
different descriptors in different
feature types and you get these

839
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:22,049
statistical summaries of what the image
looks like what the frequencies are like

840
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:26,160
and so on and then we can capitated all
those into large vectors and then we put

841
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:27,710
those into linear classifiers

842
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:32,050
so different feature types all of them
concatenated and then that went until

843
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,369
your classifiers that was usually the
pipeline so just to give you an idea of

844
01:07:35,369 --> 01:07:39,088
really what these talks were like one
very simple feature type you might

845
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:43,269
imagine is just a color histogram so I
go over all the pixels in the image and

846
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:47,449
i'd in them and to say how many bands
are there are different colors depending

847
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:50,750
on the hue of the color as you can
imagine this is kind of like one

848
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,250
statistical summary of what's in the
image is just a number of colors each

849
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:57,400
been so this will become one of my
teachers that I would eventually become

850
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:03,440
cutting with many different feature
types and other kind of intimately the

851
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,530
classifier if you think about it the
linear classifier can use these features

852
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:09,690
to actually perform the classification
because the linear classifier can like

853
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:14,320
or dislike seeing lots of different
colors in the image with positive or

854
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,930
negative what's very common features
also include things like what we call

855
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:22,440
610 hawk features basically these were
you go in local neighborhoods in the

856
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:26,539
invention and you look at whether or not
there are lots of different orientations

857
01:08:26,539 --> 01:08:30,588
so are there lots of horizontal or
vertical edges we make up histograms

858
01:08:30,588 --> 01:08:35,850
over that and so when you end up with
just the summary of what kinds of edges

859
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:40,338
are wherein the image and you can
calculate all those together there was

860
01:08:40,338 --> 01:08:45,250
lots of different types of our proposed
over to over the years just I'll be

861
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:50,359
taxed on lots of different ways of
measuring what kinds of things are there

862
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:54,850
in the image and statistics of them and
then we had these pipelines call back

863
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:59,660
over to my place where you look at
different points in your

864
01:08:59,659 --> 01:09:04,250
you describe a little local patch with
something that you come up with like

865
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:08,329
looking at the frequencies are looking
at the colors or whatever and then we

866
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:12,269
came up with these dictionaries for ok
here's the stuff we're seeing images

867
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:16,250
like there's lots of high-frequency stop
for low-frequency stuff in blue and so

868
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:16,699
on

869
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:21,338
to end up with the centroids using
k-means of what kind of stuff to be seen

870
01:09:21,338 --> 01:09:25,818
in a just and then we express every
single image as statistics over how much

871
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:29,660
of each thing we see in the image so for
example this image has lots of

872
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:33,949
high-frequency green stuff so you might
see some feature vector that basically

873
01:09:33,949 --> 01:09:38,568
will have a higher value and high
frequency and green and then we did is

874
01:09:38,569 --> 01:09:40,760
we basically took these feature vectors

875
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,210
needed them and put a linear classifier
on them so really the context for what

876
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:49,090
we're doing is as follows what it looked
like mostly computer vision before

877
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:52,840
roughly 2012 will let you take your
image and you have a step of feature

878
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:57,409
extraction where we decided what are
important things to you know about an

879
01:09:57,409 --> 01:10:01,859
image different frequencies different
tents and we decided on what are

880
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:05,109
interesting features and you see people
take like 10 different feature types in

881
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:09,369
every paper and just woke up need all of
it just hit you can double one giant

882
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:12,640
feature vector over your image and then
you put a linear classifier on top of it

883
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,920
just like we saw it right now and so you
play a train sale in your ass p.m. on

884
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,109
top of all these feature types and what
we're replacing it since then we found

885
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:24,869
that works much better as you start with
the raw image and you think of the whole

886
01:10:24,869 --> 01:10:28,979
thing you're not designing some part of
it in isolation of what you think is a

887
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:33,479
good idea or not we come up with an
architecture that can simulate a lot of

888
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:38,189
different features so to speak and since
everything is just a single function we

889
01:10:38,189 --> 01:10:41,879
don't just trying to top it on top of
the features of we can actually train

890
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,400
all the way down to the pixels and we
can train our feature extractors

891
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:49,989
effectively so that was a big innovation
and how you approach this problem is we

892
01:10:49,989 --> 01:10:53,300
try to eliminate a lot of hand
engineered components are trying to have

893
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,779
a single the principal blob so that we
can fully trained to pull things

894
01:10:56,779 --> 01:11:01,550
starting at the Rock Texas that's what
historically this is coming from and

895
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:06,760
what we will be doing and so next last
will be looking specifically at this

896
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,520
problem of we need to compute analytic
gradients and so we're going to go into

897
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,860
backpropagation which is an efficient
way of computing analytics gradient and

898
01:11:14,859 --> 01:11:18,839
so that's backdrop and you're going to
become good at it and then we're going

899
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,039
to go slightly works
