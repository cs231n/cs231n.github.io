1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
There's more seats on the side.

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:19,868
people are walking in late.
So, just to make sure you're in cs231n

3
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:23,969
Deep Learning Neural network class for
visual recognition.

4
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:33,549
Anybody in the wrong class? OK, good.
Alright. So, welcome and happy new year, happy first day of the winter break.

5
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:41,069
So, this class CS231n.
This is the second offering of this class

6
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,738
when we have literally doubled our enrollment
from 180 people last time we offered to

7
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:55,939
about 350 of you signed up.
Just a couple of words to make us all legally

8
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:02,570
covered, we are video recording this class.
So, you know if you're

9
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:10,680
uncomfortable about this for today just
go behind that camera or go to the corner that

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,280
camera's not gonna turn, but we are going to send
out forms for you to fill out in terms

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,228
of allowing video recording.
So, that's just one bit of housekeeping.

12
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:32,200
So, alright. My name is Fei-Fei Li, a professor
at the computer science department.

13
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,960
So, this class, I'm co-teaching with two
senior graduate students and one of them

14
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:45,839
is here. He's Andre Karpathy. Andre can you just say hi to everybody?
We have.. I don't think Andre needs too much

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,659
introduction. A lot of you probably know his work,

16
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,960
follow his blog, his Twitter follower.

17
00:01:53,961 --> 00:02:02,509
Andre has way more followers than I do.
So, he's very popular. And also Justin Johnson who is still

18
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,200
traveling internationally but will be
back in a few days. So, Andre and Justin

19
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:14,509
will be picking up the bulk of the
lecture teaching, and today I'll be giving

20
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:20,039
a first lecture but as you probably can
see that I'm expecting a newborn very soon,

21
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:28,239
speaking of weeks, so you'll see more of
Andre and Justin in lecture time. We will

22
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,189
also introduce a whole team of TAs
towards the end of this lecture.

23
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:38,959
Again, people who are looking for seats you go
out of that door and come back. There's

24
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:47,039
a whole bunch of seats on the side.
So, for this lecture, we're going to

25
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:53,519
give the introduction of the class,
what kind of problems we work on and the

26
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:03,530
tools will be learning. So, again, welcome
to CS231n. This is a vision class.

27
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,140
It's based on a very specific
modeling architecture called neural network

28
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:16,000
and the more specifically, mostly
on the Convolutional Neural Network

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,799
and a lot of you hear this term, maybe through a
popular press article or

30
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:34,239
coverage we tend to call this the deep
learning network. Vision is one of the fastest growing field of

31
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,920
artificial intelligence.
In fact, CISCO has estimated it and we are

32
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:50,018
day 4 of this by 2016 which we
already have arrived more than 85% of

33
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:56,230
the Internet cyberspace data is in the form of pixels

34
00:03:56,231 --> 00:04:05,329
or what they call Multimedia.
So, we basically have entered at age of vision

35
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:12,530
of images and videos.
Why is this so, well partially to a large extent

36
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:20,858
is because of the explosion of both the
Internet as a carrier of data as well as

37
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,930
sensors. We have more sensors than the
number of people on the Earth these days.

38
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:32,000
Every one of you is carrying some kind
of smart phones, digital cameras and

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,879
you know, cars running on the
street with cameras. So, the sensors

40
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:46,500
have really enabled the explosion of
visual data on the Internet but visual

41
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:55,209
data or pixel data is also the hardest
data to harness so if you have heard my

42
00:04:55,209 --> 00:05:07,810
previous talks and some other talks
by Computer Vision professors, we call this the dark matter of the Internet

43
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,879
why is this the dark matter? Just like
the universe consist of to 85% dark

44
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,409
matter. Dark energy is these matters that
energy that is very hard to observe.

45
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,919
we can infer it by mathematical models in
the universe. On the Internet these are the

46
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,649
matters pixel data are the data that we don't know.
We have a hard time

47
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:36,239
grasping the contents here's one very
very simple aspects for you to consider

48
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,090
so today

49
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:49,560
YouTube servers every 60 seconds we'll
have more than 150 hours of videos uploaded

50
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,089
onto YouTube servers for every 60 seconds

51
00:05:54,089 --> 00:06:02,739
Think about the amount of data.
There is no way that human eyes can sift through

52
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,829
this massive amount of data and make it annotations,

53
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:14,009
labeling it, and describe the contents.
So, think from the

54
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:20,980
perspective of the YouTube team or Google company.
If they want to help us

55
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,640
to search, index, manage,
and of course for their purpose,

56
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:31,529
put advertisement or whatever manipulate
the content of the data, we're at a loss,

57
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:38,919
because nobody can hand-annotate this.
The only hope we can do this is through vision

58
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,640
technology. To be able to label the
objects, find the scenes, find the frames,

59
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:50,349
you know, locate where that basketball video
were Kobe Bryant is making like that

60
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:57,320
awesome shot. So, these are the
problems that we are facing today that the

61
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:02,860
massive amount of data and the
challenges of the dark matter.

62
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,379
So, computer vision is a field that
touches upon many other fields of

63
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:12,740
studies. So, I am sure that even sitting here,

64
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,050
many of you come from computer science, but
many of you come from biology, psychology,

65
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:24,389
are specializing in natural language
processing or graphics or robotics or

66
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:30,680
or you know medical imaging and so on.
So, as a field, computer vision is really a

67
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,329
truly interdisciplinary field.
What the problems we work on, the models we use

68
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:43,849
touches an engineering, physics, biology,
psychology computer science and mathematics.

69
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:51,030
So just a little bit of a more personal touch,
I am the director of the computer vision lab

70
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:58,589
at the Stanford. In our lab,
I work with graduate students and post-docs and even

71
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:04,669
under-graduate students on the number of
topics and most dear to our own research

72
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:10,540
who some of them, you know,
Andre, Justin come from my lab.

73
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:17,780
A number of TAs come from my lab.
we work on machine learning which is part

74
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:26,109
of a superset of deep learning.
We work a lot on cognitive science and neuroscience as well

75
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,270
as the intersection between an NLP and
speech. so that's that's the kind of

76
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:40,399
landscape of computer vision research that my lab works.
So, also to put things

77
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,600
in a little more perspective, what other
computer vision classes that we offer

78
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,050
here at Stanford through the computer science department.
Clearly, you're in

79
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:59,629
this class CS231n.
So, some of you who
have never taken computer vision

80
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:06,220
probably heard of computer vision for the first time.
probably should have already

81
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:14,730
done CS131. That's an intro class of
previous quarter we offered.

82
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,779
and then next quarter which normally is
offered this quarter but this year as a

83
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:25,069
little shifted there is an important
graduate-level computer vision class

84
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,840
called CS231a offered by professor
Silvio Savarese who works in robotic

85
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:47,230
3D vision and a lot of you ask the
question that do these replace each other?
CS231n versus

86
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:56,639
CS231a and the answer is no.
if you're interested in a broader

87
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:03,220
coverage of tools and topics of computer
vision as well as some of the

88
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:11,009
fundamental topics that comes
that related to 3D vision, robotic vision

89
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:17,269
and visual recognition you should
consider taking 231a. That is the

90
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:26,039
more general class. 231n which will go
into starting today more deeply focuses

91
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:33,329
on a specific ando of both problem and
model. Model is neural network and the

92
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,580
ando is visual recognition mostly,
but of course they have a little bit of

93
00:10:38, 580 --> 00:10:47,990
overlap but that's the major difference.
Next quarter, we also have possibly

94
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:55,590
a couple of advanced seminar
level class but that's still in the

95
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:01,649
formations so you just have to check the syllabus.
So, that's the kind of computer

96
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:11,409
vision curriculum we offer this year at
Stanford. Any question so far? Yes

97
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:20,879
131 is not a strict requirement for this class,
but you should see that if you've

98
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,570
never heard of computer vision for the
first time I suggest you find a way to

99
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:33,830
catch up because this class assumes
a basic level of understanding of

100
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:42,560
computer vision.
 You can browse the notes and so on.

101
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:49,619
Okay, so the rest of today is that I will give a very brief
broad stroke history of computer vision

102
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,519
and then we'll talk about 231n
little bit in terms of the organization

103
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,409
of the class. I actually really care about sharing
with you this brief history of computer

104
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:07,480
vision because you know you might be
here primarily because of your interest

105
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,990
in this really interesting tool called
deep learning and this is the purpose of this

106
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,370
class.
We're offering you an in-depth look
and then

107
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:22,470
and just journey through the of the what
this deep learning model is but without

108
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,050
understanding the problem domain, without
thinking deeply about what this problem is,

109
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:37,849
it's very hard for you to to go out
to be an inventor of the next model that

110
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:43,320
really solves the big problem in vision or
to be you know developing developing

111
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:52,379
making impactful work in solving a hard
problem. and also in general problem

112
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,860
domain and model the modeling tools
themselves are never never fully

113
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,129
decoupled.

114
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:05,360
They inform each other and you'll see through
the history of deep learning a little

115
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,000
bit that the coalition on your network
architecture come from the need to solve

116
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,289
a vision problem

117
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:23,449
vision problem helps the the deep learning
algorithm to evolve and I'm back and

118
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:29,350
forth so is really important to to you
know I want you to finish this course I

119
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,300
feel proud that you're student of
computer vision and of deep learning so you you

120
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:39,528
have this both tool-set and the
in-depth understanding of how to use the

121
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:46,750
tool-set to to to to tackle important
problems so it's a brief history but

122
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:54,149
does it mean so short history so we're
gonna go all the way back to 200 540

123
00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:00,110
million years ago so why why did I
picked this you know on the other scale

124
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:09,240
of Earth history this is a fairly
specific range of years while so I don't

125
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,049
know if you have heard of this but this
is a very very curious period of the

126
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:23,539
Earth's history biologists call this the
big bag of evolution before 503

127
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:27,679
for 540 million years ago

128
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:37,989
a very peaceful of its pretty big pot of
water so we have very simple organisms

129
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:46,049
these are like animals that just floats
in the water and the way the eastern and

130
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:53,838
now a daily basis is you know the flow
to move some kind of food comes by near

131
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:01,160
their house or whatever they just open
their mouths grabbed it and we don't

132
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:09,969
have too many different types of animals
but really strange happened around 540

133
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:18,430
million solely from the fossils we study
there's a huge explosive of species

134
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:27,729
biologist car speciation like suddenly
for some reason something that animal

135
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:35,230
start to diversify and they got a
complex the start 2022 you start a

136
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:41,039
predators and praising and they have all
kind of tools to to to survive what was

137
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,698
the triggering force of those was a huge
question because people received no did

138
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:53,269
you know another SAT whatever meteoroid
earth or or you know the environment

139
00:15:53,269 --> 00:16:00,198
change they talk about one of the most
convincing theory is by this guy call

140
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:03,159
Andrew Parker

141
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:09,490
largest in Australia from Australia he
he studied a lot of fun

142
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:19,278
fossils and he's theory is that it was
the onset of the ice so one of the first

143
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:25,688
trial bites developed and I really
really simple I it's almost like a

144
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:30,779
pinhole camera that just catches light
and make some projections in

145
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,750
register some information from the
environment

146
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:41,080
suddenly life is no longer so medal
because once you have that I the first

147
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,889
thing you can do is you could go patch
for you actually know where food it's

148
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:51,809
not just like blind them floating in the
water and was you can go cat food

149
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:57,399
guess what the food best better develop
eyes and to run away from you otherwise

150
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:02,590
they'll be gone you know your your so
the first of all who had had eyes were

151
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:11,380
like in a limited both Google and so
just like has the best time you think

152
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,170
everything they can but because those
are all set of lies what we what the

153
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:28,400
college's realize is the biological arms
race begin every single animal needs to

154
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,170
needs to learn to develop things to
survive or to you know you you you

155
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:40,190
suddenly have praised and predators and
all this and the speciation so that's

156
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:47,870
one vision begun 540 million years and
not only religion begun visual was one

157
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:53,189
of the major driving force of the
speciation or that the big fan of

158
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,980
evolution or I so so we're not gonna
fall evolution for with too much detail

159
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:08,710
another big important work that the
engineering of vision happened around

160
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:19,220
the Renaissance and of course it's
attributed to this amazing guy so before

161
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,740
other songs you know throughout human
civilization from Asia to Europe to

162
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:30,400
India to Arabic world we have seen
models of cameras so Aristotle has

163
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,360
proposed the camera through the Leafs
Chinese philosopher moses have proposed

164
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,939
the camera through a box with the whole
but

165
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:47,750
if you look at the first documentation
really modern looking camera it's called

166
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,180
camera obscura

167
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:56,610
and that is documented by Leonardo da da
Vinci I'm not gonna get into the details

168
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:07,240
but this is you know you get the idea
that there is some kind of a whole to

169
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,240
capture light reflected from the real
world and then there is some kind of

170
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:20,319
protection to capture the information of
the of the of the real-world image so

171
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:27,779
that's the beginning of the modern you
know engineering

172
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:36,170
vision it started with one team to copy
the world and wanted to make a copy of

173
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:42,350
the visual world it hasn't gone anywhere
close to wanting to engineer the

174
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:46,879
understanding of the visual world right
now we're just talking about duplicating

175
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,760
the visual world so that's one important
work to remember and of course after

176
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:01,299
camera obscura although we we we start
to see a whole series of successful in

177
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:07,539
all some film gets developed you know
like kodak was one of the first

178
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:12,329
companies developing commercial cameras
and then we start to have camcorders and

179
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:21,889
and and all this very important
important piece of work that I want you

180
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:28,050
to be aware of as vision student is
absolutely nothing engineering work but

181
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:32,710
do you think science piece of science
work that's starting to ask the question

182
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,130
is how does Visual work in our
biological bring you know we

183
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:45,760
we now know that it took 540 million
years of evolution to get to really

184
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:54,579
fantastic visual system in humans but
what did evolution do during this time

185
00:20:54,579 --> 00:21:01,759
what kind of architecture did develop
from that simple trilobite to today

186
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,950
yours and mine while very important
piece of work happened at Harvard lied

187
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,690
to that time too young to very young
ambitious pulls the occupant in the

188
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:21,500
vehicle what they did is that they used
awake but anaesthetized cats and then

189
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,529
there was not technology to build this
little needle electrode to push the

190
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:35,129
electrons through to the the the the
skull is open until the bringing of the

191
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:42,180
cut into an area what we already know
come primary visual cortex primary

192
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:49,490
visual cortex area do a lot of things
for for visual processing but before

193
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,779
visa we don't really know what primary
visual cortex is to be winter snow is

194
00:21:54,779 --> 00:22:02,369
one of the earliest stage of the UI is
of course but earliest stage for visual

195
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:07,299
processing then there is tons and tons
of new orleans working on vision then we

196
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:12,419
really alter our to know what this is
because that's the beginning of vision

197
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:20,300
visual process in the bring so they they
put this electrode into the primary

198
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:25,930
visual cortex and an interesting this is
another interesting fact I don't drop my

199
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:34,880
stuff for sure you probably visual
cortex the first they come from being

200
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,910
very very rough prosecutor first aid of
your cortical visual processing stage is

201
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:47,180
in the back of your bring not near your
I know it's very interesting because

202
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,788
your own factory in cortical processing
is right

203
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:58,519
behind her nose your auditory is right
behind every year but your primary

204
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:05,798
visual cortex is the furthest from your
eye and another very interesting that in

205
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:11,099
fact not only the primary there's a huge
area working on vision almost 50% of

206
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:17,888
your brain is a love division this in
this the hardest and most important

207
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:22,608
sensory perceptual cognitive system in
the break and I'm not saying anything

208
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:29,839
else does is not useful clearly but it
take nature of this long to develop this

209
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:37,579
this sensory system and it takes the
troop this much realist a space to be

210
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:43,148
used for the system why because it's so
important and it's so damn hard that's

211
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:50,959
why we need to get back to human reason
they were really ambitious they wanna

212
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,028
know what primary visual cortex is doing
because this is the beginning of our

213
00:23:56,028 --> 00:24:02,878
knowledge for deep learning neural
network cats social then put the cats in

214
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:07,709
this room and they were recording your
activities when I say recording your

215
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,659
activities fair trial there basically
trying to see you know if I put the

216
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:18,059
electrode here like to the new office to
the new house fire when they see

217
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:25,308
something so for example if they show if
they show cat their ideas if I showed

218
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:30,519
this kind of fish you know apparently at
that time comes to eat fish rather than

219
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:42,019
these beings with the cats no I like
yellow happy and spikes and here's a

220
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:48,128
story of scientific discovery is
scientific discovery takes both luck and

221
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,449
care and thoughtfulness they were shown

222
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:58,740
whatever mouse flower it just doesn't
work the cats new are in the primary

223
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,839
visual cortex was silent there was no
spiking

224
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:09,079
very little spike in there were really
frustrated but the good news is that

225
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:14,509
there was no computer at that time so
what they have to do when they showed us

226
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:21,740
cats is they have to use a slight
protector so they put his foot a slide

227
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,799
of a fish and then wait till the new on
Spike if the new imposes bike they take

228
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,960
the slide out putting another slight

229
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:38,630
notice I would have liked this like you
know this film I don't you remember to

230
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:46,890
use glasser film whatever the Douro
spikes that's weird you know like the

231
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,940
actual mouse official flower didn't
drive the new excite the new role but

232
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:59,759
the the the movement of taking the slide
out nor could he has sliding did excite

233
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,140
the new I can be the catalyst think
you'll finally they're changing the new

234
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:13,410
you know new objects for me so it turned
out there is created by this life that

235
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:18,240
they're changing right slide the
whatever it's a square rectangular plate

236
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:28,120
and that moving edge or excited the
nuance so they're really taste the after

237
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:34,859
that observations you know if they were
too frustrated or to have missed that

238
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:41,359
but they're not the they're really taste
after that and realize new songs in the

239
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:48,279
primary visual cortex are organized in
columns and for every column of the new

240
00:26:48,279 --> 00:27:01,309
Alice they'd like to see a specific
orientation of the of the bars rather

241
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:02,980
than the Fisher a mouse

242
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,519
you know I'm a bit of a simple story
because there are still numerous in

243
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,940
primary visual cortex we don't know what
they like they don't like simple

244
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:17,570
oriented but by large with a human
visitor found that the beginning of

245
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:23,779
visual processing is not a holistic fish
or malice the beginning of visual

246
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:29,178
processing is simple structures of the
world

247
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:40,890
oriented and this is a very deep deep
implications are signs as well as

248
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:47,870
engineering modeling it's later when we
visualize our dealer network features

249
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:57,069
will see that simple like structure in
emerging from our from our model and

250
00:27:57,069 --> 00:28:03,298
even though the discovery was later
fifties and early sixties they won the

251
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:12,039
nobel medical price for this work in
1981 so that was another very important

252
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:25,928
piece of work related to vision and
visual processing so that's another

253
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:35,620
interesting story the precursor of
computer vision as a modern field was

254
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:42,779
this particular dissipation by Larry
Roberts in 1963 it's called block world

255
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:49,889
he just as humulin visa we're
discovering that the visual world in our

256
00:28:49,890 --> 00:29:00,380
brain is organized by simple like
structures Larry Roberts as early as PhD

257
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:06,350
students were trying to extract these
like structures

258
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,980
images

259
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:16,210
as a as a piece of engineering work in
this particular case his goal is that

260
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,210
you know both you and not as humans can
recognize blocks no matter how it's

261
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:28,009
turned right like we know it's a saint
block these two are the same block even

262
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:33,019
though the lighting changed and the
orientation changed and he's conjuncture

263
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:40,720
is that just like we thought told us
it's the edges that define this the

264
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,419
structure that the edges defying the
laws shape and they don't change

265
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:53,290
relevant all these internal things so
Larry Roberts Road a PhD dissertation to

266
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:59,250
just extract these edges you know if
your work as a PhD student computer

267
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,990
vision this is like you know this is
like undergraduate computer vision would

268
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:10,210
have been had PhD theses but that was
the first precursor computer vision PhD

269
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:18,819
theses like Robert since interest he
gave up his computer vision afterwards

270
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:27,189
and DARPA I was one of the inventors of
the internet we didn't do too badly by

271
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:34,490
giving up computer vision but we always
like to say that the birth of computer

272
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:43,960
vision as a modern field is in the
summer of 1966 the summer of 1966 MIT

273
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,548
artificial intelligence lab was
established before that actually for one

274
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:55,819
piece of history should feel proud of
them for student this there are two

275
00:30:55,819 --> 00:31:02,579
pioneering artificial intelligence lab
established in the world in the early

276
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:10,329
1960's one by Marvin Minsky at MIT one
by John McCarthy at suffered a stone for

277
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:15,369
the artificial intelligence lab was
established before the computer science

278
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:21,479
department and professor John McCarthy
who founded and I love is the one who is

279
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,490
responsible for

280
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,450
the term artificial intelligence so
that's a little bit of a problem

281
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,720
stempler history but anyway we have to
give us credit for starting the field of

282
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:41,380
computer vision because in the summer of
1966 a professor at MIT I decided it's

283
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,630
time to salvage you know so I was
established we will start to understand

284
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:55,010
I think this proves probably invented at
that time but anyway

285
00:31:55,009 --> 00:32:01,109
vision is so easy you open your eyes you
see the world how can this be love one

286
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:04,109
summer so

287
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:18,729
so the summer vision project is an
attempt to use our visual system this

288
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:24,329
was the proposal from last number and
maybe they didn't use their summer work

289
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:30,490
effectively but in any case how
individual was not solved in that silver

290
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:35,740
since then they become the fastest
growing field of computer vision and I

291
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:43,679
if you go to today's premium computer
vision conferences cost CPR or ICC we we

292
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:52,160
have like 2000 to 2500 researchers
worldwide attending this conference and

293
00:32:52,160 --> 00:33:00,620
very practical note 44 students if you
are a good computer vision / machine

294
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:05,369
learning students you will not worry
about jobs in Silicon Valley or or

295
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:11,569
anywhere else so it's actually one of
the most exciting field but that was the

296
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:19,210
birth of computer vision which means
this year is the fiftieth anniversary of

297
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:25,829
computer vision that's a very exciting
year in computer vision I we have a

298
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:28,529
caller who long long way

299
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:31,660
ok so continued of computer vision

300
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:38,169
this is a person to remember David Mark
he he was also at MIT at that time

301
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:50,240
working with a number of shimon tommy
tommy pope Jill and Mark himself died

302
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:58,808
early in the seventies very influential
book called vision it's a very book

303
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:08,148
smart thinking about vision he took a
lot of insights from your signs where he

304
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:14,868
said that he want reasonable give us the
concept of simple structure regions

305
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:16,539
start with

306
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:23,259
simple structure in today and start with
a holistic fish or holistic not was mark

307
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,679
give us the next important insight and
these two inside together is the

308
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:35,740
beginning of deep learning architecture
is that vision is hierarchical you know

309
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:44,029
so you will have easily said ok we start
simple but this major world is extremely

310
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:49,540
complex in fact I take a picture a
regular picture today with my eiffel

311
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:58,309
there is no my iPhone's resolution let's
suppose it's like turned up exhaust the

312
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:05,059
potential combination of pixels or
picture in that is bigger than the total

313
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:11,429
number of atoms in the universe that's
how complex vision can be is it's it's

314
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:18,539
really really complex human beings are
told us they are simple David Mark told

315
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:25,130
us build a hierarchical model of course
there mark didn't tell us to build it in

316
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,400
the coalition on your network which will
cover for the rest of the quarter but

317
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,990
his ideas is to represent or to think
about it image we think about it in

318
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:42,129
several layers the first one he thinks
we should think about that edge image

319
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:49,110
which is clearly an inspiration noted
took the inspiration from these oh and

320
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,579
he personally called this the primal
sketch

321
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:55,730
you know the name is Sophie explain it

322
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:02,400
explained every now and then you think
about one-half the this is work you

323
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,829
start to Rick reconcile your 2d image
with the 3d world you recognize there is

324
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:15,679
layers right I look at you right now I
don't think half of you only has upheld

325
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,239
in the neck

326
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:22,799
even though that's all I see there is I
know you're all concluded by the row in

327
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,680
front of you and this challenge will
post problem to solve

328
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:38,118
nature had that you oppose prob to solve
because the broadest 3d imagery 2d

329
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:45,210
nature saw that my first a hard work
trick we just to ice it did they use one

330
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:49,389
I but there's gonna be a whole bunch of
hoes software trick to lurch the

331
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:53,868
formation of the two eyes and Aldous so
the same thing with computer vision we

332
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:59,280
have to solve that too and have tea
problem and they eventually we have to

333
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,180
put everything together so that we
actually have a good 3d model of the

334
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:08,629
world why do we have to have a 3d model
of the world as we have to survive

335
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:15,309
navigate manipulate the world when I
shake your hand I really need to know

336
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:16,509
how do you know

337
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:22,320
external my hand and grab your heading
the right way that is a 3d modeling of

338
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,000
the world otherwise I won't be able to
grab your head in the right way when I

339
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:34,219
pick up a mug the same thing so so
that's that's that's David Marr's

340
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:39,899
architecture for vision that's a
high-level abstract architecture it

341
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,490
doesn't really inform us exactly what
kind of mathematical modeling we should

342
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:51,439
it doesn't inform us of the learning
procedure and they really does the

343
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,599
inference procedure which we will
getting to through the deep learning

344
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,759
that word architecture but that's not
that's the high-level view of important

345
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,250
it's an important concept to learn

346
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,619
envisioned and we call this the

347
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:16,859
representation really important work and
this is a little bit stuff first trip to

348
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:25,180
just show you as soon as they lead out
this important way of thinking about the

349
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:31,879
first wave of visual recognition
algorithms went after the 3d model

350
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,280
because that's the goal right like no
matter how you represent the stages the

351
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:45,519
goal here is to reconstruct recognized
object and this is really sensible

352
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:52,380
because that's when we go to the world
and do so both of these to your work

353
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,829
comes from Palo Alto one of those from
sum 41 as far as ROI Sao Tome before was

354
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:00,440
a professor at Stanford

355
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,760
I love that he and his two directly
Brooks proposed 11 of the first

356
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,430
so-called generalized till salu model
I'm not gonna get into the details but

357
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:17,129
the idea is that the world is composed
of simple shapes like

358
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:23,150
wonders blocks and then any real world
object is just a combination of these

359
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:28,340
simple shapes given the particular
feeling and go and that was a very

360
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:37,970
influential visual recognition model in
the seventies and went on to become the

361
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:47,239
Director of MIT lab and he was also a
founding member of iRobot company rumba

362
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:51,379
and all this so so he continued the very
influential

363
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,930
I work and nobody interesting model
coming from local

364
00:39:56,929 --> 00:40:05,009
Research Institute I think I saw I is
across the street from El Camino is this

365
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:15,260
pictorial structure model has less of a
3d flavor but more of a probabilistic

366
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,570
flavor is that the objects are made of a
still simple part

367
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:28,059
like a person's head is made of eyes and
nose or mouth and the parts were CuMn

368
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:34,679
acted by springs allowing for some
deformations getting a sense of ok we

369
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:40,069
recognize the world not every one of you
have exactly the same eyes in the

370
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:45,150
distance between the eyes will allow for
some kind of rare variability so this

371
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,450
concept of variability start to get
introduced in the model like this and

372
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:56,309
using models like this you know the
reason I want to show you this is too to

373
00:40:56,309 --> 00:41:02,710
see how simple the the worst was a tease
this was one of the most influential

374
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:09,670
model in the eighties recognizing
real-world objects and the entire paper

375
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:18,900
of real world is these seemingly users
but the using the edges and simple

376
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:26,010
shapes warm but edges to to recognize
this by another and other stuff or

377
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:33,980
graduate so that's that's that's kind of
the incident world of computer vision

378
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:39,699
will wind up being seen black and white
or even synthetic images started the

379
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:46,529
nineties we're finally started moving to
like color images of real world and it

380
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:55,210
was a big change again very very
influential work here is not

381
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:01,150
particularly about recognizing an object
is about how do it like carve out an

382
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:08,990
image into sensible parts right so if
you enter this room there's no way your

383
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:15,559
visual system is tell you of my god I
see so many pics it was only have group

384
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:22,259
things you see heads heads have
territory chair a stage platform piece

385
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,640
of furniture in the oldest this is
called perceptual grouping perceptual

386
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,309
grouping as one of me

387
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:34,779
most important problem envision
biological or artificial if we don't

388
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,420
know how to solve the perceptual
grouping problem where they have a

389
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:46,690
really hard time to to deeply understand
the visual world and you aren't words

390
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:53,450
that end of this class this course a
problem as fundamental as the still not

391
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:57,859
solved in computer vision even though we
have made a lot of progress before

392
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:04,390
departing after deplaning we're still
grasping the final solution to a problem

393
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:10,650
like this so so this is again I why I
want to give you at this introduction to

394
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:16,950
for you to be aware of the deep problems
evasion and also the then-current they

395
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:22,730
in the the the the challenges envision
we cannot solve all the problems despite

396
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:29,079
whatever the noose s you know like we're
far from developing terminators who can

397
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:34,860
do everything so this piece of work is
called normalized cut is what is one of

398
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:42,390
the first computer vision work that
takes real world images and tries to

399
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:52,420
solve the problem is the senior computer
vision researcher now professor at

400
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,000
berkeley also stanford graduate

401
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,989
the results are not great I will not
cover any sedimentation in this class

402
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:08,459
from where you see we are making
progress but this is the beginning of

403
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:15,510
that another very casual work that I
want to i want to bring up and pay

404
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:22,410
tribute for even though these work we're
not covering them in the rest of the

405
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:26,679
course but I think it has a vision
student pretty important for you to be

406
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:31,199
aware of this because not only
introduces the important problem we want

407
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:36,730
to solve it also gives you a perspective
of the development of the field let's

408
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,480
work is called villa jones face detector

409
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,030
it's very dear to my heart because as a
graduate student fresh graduate student

410
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:51,650
at cal tech it's the one of the first
papers I read as a graduate student when

411
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,150
I until the lab and I didn't know
anything about it my advisers with this

412
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:02,090
amazing piece of work that you know
we're all trying to understand them by

413
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:08,690
the time I graduated from Celtic this
very work is transferred to the first

414
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:16,510
smart digital camera by Fujifilm in 2006
as the first digital camera that has a

415
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:22,390
face detector so far my transfer pump
technology transfer point of view it was

416
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:28,789
extremely fast and there was one of the
first successful high-level visual

417
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:35,849
recognition algorithm that's being used
by consumer product so let's work just

418
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:41,059
learns to detect faces and faces in the
wild with no longer soon you know

419
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:47,920
simulation they are a very contrived a
these are any pictures and even though

420
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,329
he didn't use a deep learning network it
has a lot of the deep learning flavor

421
00:45:53,329 --> 00:46:01,179
the features were learned the algorithm
learns to find features simple features

422
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:06,919
like these black and white filter
features that can you give us the best

423
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:14,639
localization of faces so this is a very
influential piece of work it's also one

424
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:24,679
of the first computer visual work that
is deployed computer and can roam real

425
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:31,019
time before that comparison algorithms
were very slow the the paper actually is

426
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:36,699
called real-time face detection it was
granted send him to tips I don't know if

427
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:41,409
anybody remember that kind of chip but
it was not a slow chat but nevertheless

428
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:48,569
it run real time that was another very
important piece of art and also one more

429
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:53,380
thing to point out around this time this
is not the only work

430
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:59,170
but this is a a really good
representation Morales time the focus of

431
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:06,250
computer vision is shifting remember
that they've Mr

432
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:14,699
early for work was trying to model the
three the shape of the object now we're

433
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:23,439
shifting to recognizing what the object
is the little bit about can we really

434
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,400
reconstruct these phases or not there's
a whole branch of computer vision

435
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:34,200
graphics step continue to work on that
but a big part of computer vision is not

436
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:38,730
at this time around the turn of the
century is focusing on recognition

437
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:47,539
that's bringing computer vision and
today the most important parts of the

438
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:55,480
computer vision work is focused these
cognitive questions like recognition and

439
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,369
I questions

440
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:06,150
another very important piece of work is
starting to focus on features so around

441
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:12,950
the time of face recognition people
start to realize it's really really hard

442
00:48:12,949 --> 00:48:19,829
to recognize an object by describing the
whole thing like I just said you know I

443
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:25,960
see you guys were heavily on concluded I
don't see the rest of your torso I

444
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:31,690
really don't see any of your legs on it
in the first row but I recognize you and

445
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:39,230
i ke fir you as an object so some people
start to realize she is fun this is

446
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:44,240
really a global shape now we have to go
after in order to recognize an object

447
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:50,319
maybe it's the features if we recognize
the important features an object we can

448
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,090
go a long way and makes a lot of sense

449
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,930
think about evolution if you are out
hunting you don't need to recognize that

450
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:03,909
Tigers full body in shape to decide you
need to run away you know there's a few

451
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:06,588
patches of the first of the tiger
through the

452
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:12,679
leaves probably cool arm you enough so
so we need to listen as quick

453
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:16,429
decision-making baseball's version is
really quick

454
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:22,308
a lot of this happens online important
features so this will cost shift by

455
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:28,539
David low again you saw that name again
is about learning important important

456
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:34,009
features on an object and once you learn
these important features just a few of

457
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:38,400
them on the object you can actually
recommends this object in a totally

458
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:45,548
different and go on the tolling
cluttered scenes so up to keep learnings

459
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:54,880
research election in 2010 or 2012 for
about 10 years the entire field of

460
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,229
computer vision was focusing on using
these features to build models to

461
00:50:00,228 --> 00:50:05,538
recognize objects and scenes and we've
done a great job we've gone a long way

462
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:12,609
one of the reasons deep learning that
word was became more more convincing to

463
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:17,690
a lot of people is we will see that the
features that a deep learning that

464
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:22,880
learners is very similar to these
engineered features by brilliant

465
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:30,229
engineers so it kind of confirmed even
know you know if needed we needed them

466
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:34,929
below to first tell us this features
work and then we start to develop better

467
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:38,978
mathematical models to learn these
features by itself but they confirmed

468
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:46,210
each other so so the historical you know
importance of this work should not be

469
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:52,028
diminished this work is the intellectual
foundation for us one of the

470
00:50:52,028 --> 00:50:57,858
intellectual foundation for us to
realize that how critical or how useful

471
00:50:57,858 --> 00:51:07,018
these deep learning features are where
we learn them just briefly say because

472
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:12,379
of the features that have a low and many
other researchers told us we can't use

473
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:18,239
that to to learn scene recognition and
around that time the machine learning

474
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:24,719
tools we use mostly is either graphical
models or support vector machine and

475
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:29,479
this is one influential work on using
support vector machine and colonel

476
00:51:29,478 --> 00:51:43,358
models 2222 recognizes thing but I'll be
brief here and last deep learning model

477
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:50,578
is this feature or feature baseball
called deformable part Waldo is where we

478
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:57,420
learn parts of object like parts of the
person and we learn how they come figure

479
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:08,519
each other income figure in space used a
support vector machine kind of model to

480
00:52:08,518 --> 00:52:16,179
recognize objects like humans and
bottles around this time that's 2009

481
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:21,419
2010 the field of computer vision is
mature enough that we're working on this

482
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,659
important on the heart probably
recognize the pedestrians and

483
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:30,828
recognizing cars they're no longer
contrived problem something else was

484
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:37,219
needed his bench partly because as a
field advancing now if we don't have

485
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:44,039
good benchmark then everybody feels set
of images and it's really hard to really

486
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:50,369
set global standard so one of the most
important benchmark is called pass goal

487
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:57,608
V oc object recognition bench part its
bio European it's a european effort that

488
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:04,190
researchers put together by tens of
thousands of images from 20 classes of

489
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:13,019
optics and these are one example per per
object like cats cults cows movie no

490
00:53:13,018 --> 00:53:17,808
cats dogs cows airplanes bottles

491
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:20,048
horses trained

492
00:53:20,048 --> 00:53:27,268
and Aldous and then we used and then
annually our computer vision researchers

493
00:53:27,268 --> 00:53:34,948
and laps come to compete all the object
recognition task for best girl object

494
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:41,188
recognition challenge and an over the
past you know like through the years the

495
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:47,949
the performance just keeps increasing
and that was when we start to feel

496
00:53:47,949 --> 00:53:52,929
excited about the progress of the field
at that time

497
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:59,729
here's a little bit over more closer
story close to us is that my love of my

498
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:05,718
students were thinking you know the real
world is not about 20 objects the real

499
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:12,489
world is a little more than 20 optics so
following the work of Pasco visual

500
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:18,239
object recognition challenge we put
together this massive massive project

501
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:23,889
image that some of you may have heard of
image that in this class you will be

502
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:30,098
using the tiny portion of the image that
in some of your assignment that image

503
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:36,759
that is the data set of 50 million
images all cleaned my hands and

504
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:47,000
annotated over 20,000 object classes to
students who cleaned it

505
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:54,469
various areas of my life remove the
crowdsourcing platform of the habits of

506
00:54:54,469 --> 00:54:59,969
that Gladys dunno also suffered from you
know putting together this this platform

507
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:08,599
but it's a very exciting day does not we
started we started to put together

508
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:15,900
competitions annually called image that
competition for object recognition and

509
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:22,440
for example a standard competition of
image classification by Imogen that is a

510
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:28,710
thousand object classes over almost 1.5
million images and algorithms compete on

511
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:34,220
the performance so actually I just heard
somebody who was on the social media was

512
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:38,589
referring image that challenges the
Olympics of computer vision I was very

513
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:40,240
flattering

514
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:55,649
bringing us close to the history making
the people are so so that challenge 2010

515
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:00,369
that's actually around the time pass go
you know where their colleagues they

516
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:05,309
told us they're gonna start to phase out
their challenge of 20 object so we face

517
00:56:05,309 --> 00:56:12,039
in the thousand object images a
challenge and why accesses error rate

518
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:18,199
and we start to we started with very
significant error and of course you know

519
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:28,029
every year that decreased but there is a
particularly years really decreased it

520
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:38,960
was cutting hot almost is 2012 2012 is
the year that the winning architecture

521
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:45,769
of image that challenge was a
convolution on your network I will talk

522
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:53,250
about it was not invented in 2012
despite how all the new speaker's felt

523
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:58,190
like it's the newest thing around the
block it's not it was invented back in

524
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,349
the seventies and eighties

525
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:05,279
he's but having a convergence of things
will talk about convolution on your

526
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,519
network showed its massive power as a
high capacity and to end training

527
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:18,219
architecture and Wang the image that
challenged by a huge margin and that was

528
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:24,829
quite a historical moment from a a
mathematical point of view it wasn't

529
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:30,079
that new before my engineering and and
solving real-world point of view this

530
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,090
was a historical moment that piece of
work was covered by you know numerous

531
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:42,400
times and all this this is the onset
this is the beginning of learning

532
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:48,869
revolution if you call it and this is
the premise of this class so at this

533
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:54,609
point I'm gonna switch so we went
through a brief history of computer

534
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:59,539
vision for 540 million years

535
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:05,869
overview of this class is there any
other question

536
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:13,969
alright so we're talking even though it
was kind of overwhelming we talked a lot

537
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:20,559
about finding different task in computer
vision seems to 31 and is going to focus

538
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:27,849
on the visual recognition problem also
enlarged especially through most of the

539
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:29,509
foundation lecture

540
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:35,750
classification but now you know
everything we talk about is gonna be

541
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:41,480
based on that image that classification
set up we will we were getting to other

542
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:47,900
visual recognition scenarios but the
image classification problem is the main

543
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:52,780
problem we will focus on Emma's class
which means please keep in mind

544
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:56,600
visual recognition is not just image
classification right there was 3d

545
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:01,339
modeling there was a grouping of
segmentation and all this but that's

546
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:06,250
that's what we'll focus on and I don't
need to call miss you that just even

547
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:11,000
application wise image classification is
extremely useful problem

548
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,929
from you know big big commercial
Internet companies a point of view to

549
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:22,449
startup ideas you know you want to
recognize objects you want to recognize

550
00:59:22,449 --> 00:59:29,119
food do online shop mobile shopping you
want us torture albums so you move

551
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:35,710
classification news is is can be a
bread-and-butter task for many many

552
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:44,650
important problems there is a problem
that's related to two classification and

553
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:49,329
today I don't expect you to understand
the differences but I wanted to hear

554
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:55,659
that while this class will make sure you
learn to understand the nuances in the

555
00:59:55,659 --> 01:00:01,879
the details of different flavors of
visual recognition what is image

556
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:07,700
classification what's object detection
what's image captioning and these have

557
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:14,529
different flavors for example you know
while he made two classification my

558
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:19,740
focus on the whole big image object
detection by tell you where things

559
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:23,579
exactly are like where the car is the
pedestrian

560
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:30,159
the hammer and the word that the
relationship between objects and so on

561
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:35,529
social their nuances and details that
you will be learning about in this class

562
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:43,840
and I already said CNN or coalition on
your network is one type of deeply

563
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:50,910
architecture but it's the overwhelmingly
successful the planning architecture and

564
01:00:50,909 --> 01:00:54,909
this is the architecture we will be
focusing on and to just go back to the

565
01:00:54,909 --> 01:01:02,849
image 9 challenge so I said the
historical year is 2012 this is the year

566
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:14,349
I'll excursion Jeff Hinton proposed this
this convolutional I think it's a seven

567
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:20,500
layer convolutional your network to win
the image that challenge model before

568
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,318
this year

569
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:30,548
a SIFT feature plus support vector
machine architecture it still hierarchy

570
01:01:30,548 --> 01:01:38,449
but it doesn't have that flavor of and
two and learning fast forward to 2015

571
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:43,798
the winning architecture is still a
conclusion you're not worried it's a

572
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:56,599
hunter 51 layers buy buy microsoft Asia
research researchers and it's clear

573
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:03,048
reason the residual that the residual
that so I'm not so sure you for a cover

574
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:09,369
that definitely don't expect to to know
every single layer what they do actually

575
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:17,269
they repeat itself at heart but every
year since 2012 the winning architecture

576
01:02:17,268 --> 01:02:23,548
of images that challenge is a deep
learning based architecture so like I

577
01:02:23,548 --> 01:02:32,369
said I also want you to respect history
is not invented overnight there is a lot

578
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:37,979
of influential players today but you
know there are a lot of people who build

579
01:02:37,978 --> 01:02:41,879
a foundation I actually I don't have the
slides one important thing to remember

580
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:50,910
is Kunihiko Fukushima contigo solution
was a Japanese scientist who build a

581
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:58,798
model corneil Kong the truck and that
was the beginning of the newer network

582
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:04,318
architecture and yellow color is also a
very influential person and he's really

583
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:10,248
the the groundbreaking work in my
opinion of young coup was published in

584
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:16,348
the nineteen nineties so that's one
mathematicians which Jeff Hinton

585
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:22,479
all-inclusive adviser was involved
worked out the back propagation learning

586
01:03:22,478 --> 01:03:28,088
strategy which if this were deleting
anything under will tell you in a couple

587
01:03:28,088 --> 01:03:34,528
of weeks but but the the mathematical
mando was roughed up in the eighties and

588
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:34,920
the

589
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,869
undies and this was your local was
working for Bell Labs it AT&T which is

590
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:47,160
amazing place at that time there's no
bail UPS today anymore that they were

591
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:50,949
working on really ambitious projects and
he needed to recognize the digits

592
01:03:50,949 --> 01:03:57,019
because even to leave that product was
shipped to our bags in the USA post

593
01:03:57,019 --> 01:04:03,380
office to recognize difficult and checks
and kinky constructive those coalition

594
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:08,068
on your network and this is where he
he's inspired by Hubel and Wiesel he

595
01:04:08,068 --> 01:04:14,500
starts by looking at some pool edge like
structures and image it's not like the

596
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:20,099
whole letter eight it's really needs to
edges and the layer-by-layer

597
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:25,539
filters these edges pull them together
filters pool and then the field this

598
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:36,230
architecture 20121 Alex kruschev ski and
Jeff Hinton you almost exactly the thing

599
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:40,900
architecture to participate in the car

600
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:47,900
imagine a challenge there is a few
changes but that become the winning

601
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:54,920
architecture of this so we'll tell you
more about the detail changes at the lib

602
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:02,380
capacity model did grow a little bit
because Moore's Law helped us there's

603
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:08,220
also a very very detailed function that
change the little bit of a shape for

604
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:14,828
most Signori 224 but to file in their
shape but whatever there's a couple of

605
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:19,130
small changes but really by large
nothing had changed

606
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:26,490
mathematically but important things did
change and that grow deep learning

607
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:35,379
Architektur black ink crew into its
Renaissance one is like a morsel and

608
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:41,180
hardware hardware made a huge difference
because these are high extremely high

609
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:44,669
capacity models one dela Cruz

610
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:50,720
this painfully slow because of the the
bottleneck of computation he couldn't

611
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:55,209
build this model too big a while so you
cannot be added to big cannot fully

612
01:05:55,210 --> 01:06:00,670
realize its potential for machine
learning standpoint there's over 15 and

613
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:07,780
all these problems you can also but now
we have much faster bigger transistor

614
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:16,410
transistor microchips and GPUs from
Nvidia made a huge difference in deep

615
01:06:16,409 --> 01:06:22,358
learning history that we can now
trainees models in a reasonable amount

616
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:27,358
of time even if they're huge and others
I think we do need to take her out of

617
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:37,159
work is data availability of data that
was the big data did a self is just you

618
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:41,078
know it doesn't mean anything if you
don't know how to use it but in this

619
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:45,869
deep learning Architektur data become
the driving force for high-capacity

620
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:52,390
model to enable the doin training true
true true help avoid overfitting when

621
01:06:52,389 --> 01:06:57,608
you have enough data so you know so you
if you look at the number of pixels that

622
01:06:57,608 --> 01:07:05,639
machine learning people had in 2012
versus helical having 1998 it's a huge

623
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:06,469
difference

624
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:14,469
orders of magnitude so so that was so
this is the focus of 231

625
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:21,098
but will also go oh it's also important
one last time I'm drooling this idea

626
01:07:21,099 --> 01:07:27,048
that visual intelligence does go beyond
object recognition I don't want any of

627
01:07:27,048 --> 01:07:31,039
you coming out of this course dinky
we've done everything you know we've

628
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:38,889
challenged do flying the entire space of
visual recognition it's not true there

629
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:44,460
are still a lot of cool problems to
solve for example you know does labeling

630
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:51,650
entire scene with perceptual grouping so
I know where every single pixel belonged

631
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,329
to

632
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:56,900
that's still ongoing problem combining

633
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:02,740
recognition with 3d is a really there's
a lot of excitement happening at the

634
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:09,349
intersection of vision and robotics this
is this is definitely one area of that

635
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:15,039
and then anything to do with motion of
borders and and and and this is another

636
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:33,289
big open area of research work you know
beyond just gonna sing you actually want

637
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:35,689
deeply understand the victor

638
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:39,489
what people are doing what are the
relationship between objects in the West

639
01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:45,029
Rd into the the the relation between
objects and this is an ongoing project

640
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:49,759
called visual genome in my lap that just
in the number of my students are

641
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:55,739
involved and this goes far beyond image
classification of weed we talked about

642
01:08:55,739 --> 01:09:03,639
and what is one of our Holy Grails while
one of the Holy Grails of community this

643
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:09,260
to be able to tell the story of a scene
right so I think about you as a human

644
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,180
you open your eyes

645
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:17,840
the moment you open your eyes you're
able to describe what you see in fact in

646
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:24,940
psychology experiments we find that even
if you show people this picture for only

647
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:30,659
five hundred milliseconds that's
literally half of the second people who

648
01:09:30,659 --> 01:09:36,769
write essays about it we pay them $10 an
hour so they didn't

649
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:42,410
it wasn't that long but you know I
figure if we talked more money they

650
01:09:42,409 --> 01:09:47,970
probably could write longer ethics but
the point is that our visual system is

651
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:54,390
extremely powerful we can tell stories
and I would dream of this is my cell is

652
01:09:54,390 --> 01:10:02,560
to undress dissertation that we give you
give a computer one picture per and

653
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,960
outcomes

654
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:09,159
description like this you know I was
getting there you'll see that give the

655
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:15,149
khmer Olympic tur gives you one sentence
or you give the number one pick turned

656
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:20,319
into a short sentences but we're not
here yet but that's one of the holder

657
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:26,250
blue and the other holding growth is
continuing this continue this i think is

658
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:33,659
is summarized really well by Audrey's
blog is you know like this right there

659
01:10:33,659 --> 01:10:42,300
is refined there so much nuance in this
picture that you get to enjoy not only

660
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:47,890
you recognize the global seek it will be
very boring old computer can tell you is

661
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:53,650
that room room scale

662
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:58,238
whatever type in the locker that's it
you know here you recognize what they

663
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:00,569
are recognized the trick

664
01:11:00,569 --> 01:11:06,009
Obama is do you recognize the kind of
interaction you recognize the humor you

665
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:11,250
recognize there's just so much knew that
this is one of the world is about we

666
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:18,719
used our ability to visual nurse tending
to not only survive navigate when they

667
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:26,000
play but we use it to socialize to
entertain to understand the world and

668
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,929
this is where vision in all the book
read goals of vision that is so and I

669
01:11:32,929 --> 01:11:39,630
don't need to convince you that computer
visual technology will make our world a

670
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:46,550
better place despite some scary talks
out there you know even though you home

671
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:51,029
today in the industry as well as
research world we're using computer

672
01:11:51,029 --> 01:11:58,349
vision to build better robots to save
lives to go deep exploring analyst now

673
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:02,860
ok so I have like what two minutes 35
minutes left

674
01:12:02,859 --> 01:12:10,839
great time let me introduce the team and
justice are the color instructors with

675
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:16,989
me tienes please stand up to say hi to
him

676
01:12:16,989 --> 01:12:22,639
can you like this safe your name quickly
and you're like what you just don't give

677
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:49,180
a speech but yes

678
01:12:49,180 --> 01:13:42,240
because because people class action and
help us to process I respect a person is

679
01:13:42,239 --> 01:14:04,739
confidential personal issues but again
I'm going on our terms and leave for a

680
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:09,939
few weeks starting the end of January
social please if you decide you just

681
01:14:09,939 --> 01:14:15,379
want to send email to me unless somebody
like you they will take

682
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:20,770
I'm likely to a reply you promptly sorry
about that

683
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:25,420
priorities

684
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:34,739
about our philosophy and we're not
getting to the details we really want

685
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:39,448
this to be a very hands-on project this
is really I give a lot of credit to

686
01:14:39,448 --> 01:14:46,419
Justin and Andre they are extremely good
at walking through these hands-on

687
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:51,840
details with you so that when you come
out of this class you not only have I

688
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:57,719
love understanding but you have a you
have a really good ability to to build

689
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:02,010
your own deep learning code we want you
to be exposed to state of the art

690
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:08,730
material you're gonna be learning things
really that's as freshest 2015 and it'll

691
01:15:08,729 --> 01:15:11,859
be fun you get to do things like this

692
01:15:11,859 --> 01:15:18,960
not not all the time but like time the
picture into one goal or or this weird

693
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:27,489
thing it'll be a fun class in addition
to all the important tasks you you you

694
01:15:27,488 --> 01:15:33,589
you learn we do have grading policies
these are all on our website another

695
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:44,929
eatery those again one very clear you
are grown ups which grew to like

696
01:15:44,929 --> 01:15:51,989
grown-ups we do not take anything at the
end of the course is my professors want

697
01:15:51,988 --> 01:15:56,359
me to go to this conference and I have
to have like three more late they say no

698
01:15:56,359 --> 01:16:03,630
you are responsible for using your total
eight days you have 7 late you can use

699
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:11,079
them in whatever way you all 10 penalty
be all those you have to take a penalty

700
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:18,069
is like really really exceptional
medical family emergency

701
01:16:18,069 --> 01:16:21,799
talk to us on the individual basis but
anything else

702
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:29,539
conference that why other finally you
know like missing cat or whatever is

703
01:16:29,539 --> 01:16:37,850
we we we we budgeted that into the seven
days another his honor cold this is one

704
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:43,190
thing I have to say it with a really
straight face you are such a privilege

705
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:50,710
institution you are you are grown ups I
want you to be responsible for honor

706
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:55,239
code every single Stampfer student
taking this class should know the other

707
01:16:55,239 --> 01:16:58,619
co if you don't there's no excuse you
should go back

708
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:04,840
wait a collaboration extremely seriously

709
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:10,380
given a classless big word Allah have a
few cases but I also want you to be an

710
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:16,210
exceptional class even with a size this
big we do not want to see anything that

711
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:22,399
infringes on Academic Honor Code so read
the collaboration policies and risk but

712
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:31,960
that this is really respecting yourself
I think with all these prereq you can

713
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:38,149
you can read it I do with anything I
want to say is there any burning

714
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:47,569
questions that you feel worth asking yes
